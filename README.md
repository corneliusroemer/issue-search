# Better Github Issue Search

Query Github issues with Algolia.

## Plan

### Get issues

- Only get first post in standard API response
- Also contains pull requests naively
- `timeline_url` for full issue
- Eventually put issues into sqlite
- Can then refresh with `updated_at`

### Transform for Algolia

### Push to Algolia

### Query Algolia
