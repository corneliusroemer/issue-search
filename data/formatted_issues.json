In between statuses changed. What made it worse was that each of the calls was hugely inefficient, using a join on data use terms, ordering by accession column and much more that is totally unnecessary for the counts calculation.\nThe fluctuation could be fixed by higher transaction isolation but this is much much faster and efficient so should be enough (I've profiled with simple logs and tested).\nAlso fixes fact that log message misses mention of some filters.\nFuture work\nThere's still lots to be done but this goes some way and fixes the inconsistency bug.\nWe should not have this single endpoint that calculates much more than necessary. It's behind the review page slowness #3269: we really just want total numbers of sequences to review but the backend needs to send loads of unnecessary information to the website simply because we have no simpler endpoint.\nInstead, we should spin up a few simple endpoints that do what the website needs - let's mark them as \"non-public\" in the backend API docs so that we don't need stability guarantees, they should be used solely by the website.\nScreenshot\nReload the page and look at both screencasts together to see speedup.\nThis PR:\n\nBefore (main):\n\nPR Checklist\n\n\n All necessary documentation has been adapted.\n The implemented feature is covered by an appropriate test.",

    "body": "I bumped processing pipeline version on virus2 to v2 and noticed the backend didn't upgrade. Inspecting the db showed that 15 sequences weren't processed by v2, these also weren't in processing or anything.\nInspection of the audit logs showed that the 15 sequences that were not getting processed had been deleted by a user while they were not yet released.\nBecause we don't properly use foreign key constraints (we really should, see #3201) it's possible that sequence entries disappear but the processed data remains without the db complaining (the db would have made us notice this bug much earlier and probably more bugs like that).\nThe fix is probably to delete all processed rows associated with an unreleased deleted entry. There might well be edge cases that will remain tricky, and until we have foreign key constraints I won't trust us to be bug free there.\nWe haven't noticed this because we never tried to upgrade pipeline version after someone had deleted something - kind of hard to test using our current setup. That's why foreign key constraints would be so useful. @chaoran-chen likely thought there were such constraints in place, at least in terms of the outcome of deletions - hence the case of entries are deleted, processed data is still there wasn't considered.",

    "body": "resolves #2793\npreview URL: https://enforce-schema.loculus.org\nWhat does this PR solve?\nThis PR resolves 2 issues discussed among others in #2793 but recapitulated here:\n\nWe were wasting db storage and bandwidth by storing lots of metadata fields with null values in sequence_entries_preprocessed_data.processed_data in the db - in Pathoplexus this wastage might even be 50% or more of total row size, reaching a point that's worth optimizing.\nWhenever we wanted to add a new metadata field, we needed to reprocess the data because the backend would rigidly send exactly what it had in sequence_entries_preprocessed_data.processed_data to the get-released-data consumer and SILO's preprocessing doesn't like missing (or extra as well, I think) fields in NDJSON. This created a lot of friction in deployment.\n\nWhat does this PR do?\nThis PR introduces the idea of metadata compression, in parallel to the existing sequence compression. This fits very nicely into the existing code base, making the actual code (non-test) changes trivial.\n\nProcessed metadata is compressed before being stored in the db by removing all fields that have null values: \n  \n    \n      loculus/backend/src/main/kotlin/org/loculus/backend/service/submission/CompressionService.kt\n    \n    \n         Line 121\n      in\n      6716149\n    \n  \n  \n    \n\n        \n          \n           processedData.metadata.filterNot { (_, value) -> value.isNull }, \n        \n    \n  \n\n\nProcessed metadata is decompressed after being retrieved from the db by filling back null to all the fields that are missing. At the same time, fields that are no longer in the current metadata schema are dropped so as to allow us to remove no-longer-wanted metadata fields: \n  \n    \n      loculus/backend/src/main/kotlin/org/loculus/backend/service/submission/CompressionService.kt\n    \n    \n        Lines 89 to 96\n      in\n      6716149\n    \n  \n  \n    \n\n        \n          \n           backendConfig \n        \n\n        \n          \n               .getInstanceCon",

Here are the key areas that could be enhanced:\nMissing Foreign Keys:\n\nmetadata_upload_aux_table has no FK constraint for group_id\nmetadata_upload_aux_table and sequence_upload_aux_table share upload_id and submission_id but have no FK relationship\nexternal_metadata has no FK to sequence_entries for accession and version\ndata_use_terms_table has no FK to sequence_entries for accession\nsequence_entries_preprocessed_data has no FK to sequence_entries for accession and version\n\nMissing ENUM Types:\n\nsequence_entries_preprocessed_data.processing_status could be an ENUM ('IN_PROCESSING', 'HAS_ERRORS', 'FINISHED')\nseqset_records.type could be an ENUM\nThe status field in sequence_entries_view uses hardcoded strings that should be an ENUM ('APPROVED_FOR_RELEASE', 'AWAITING_APPROVAL', 'IN_PROCESSING', 'HAS_ERRORS', 'RECEIVED')\ndata_use_terms_type could be an ENUM\n\nData Integrity:\n\nNo CHECK constraints on timestamps to ensure logical order (e.g., finished_processing_at should be after started_processing_at)\nNo CHECK constraints on version being positive\n\nMissing Indexes:\n\nNo index on group_id in sequence_entries despite being a foreign key\n\nPerformance:\n\nLarge JSONB columns (processed_data, external_metadata, etc.) might benefit from specific indexes on commonly queried paths\nConsider partitioning large tables like sequence_entries if the data volume is high\n\nFrom Claude:\nHere's what I would implement first:\n\nAdd missing foreign keys\n\nALTER TABLE metadata_upload_aux_table \nADD CONSTRAINT fk_metadata_upload_group \nFOREIGN KEY (group_id) REFERENCES groups_table(group_id);\n\nALTER TABLE external_metadata \nADD CONSTRAINT fk_external_metadata_sequence \nFOREIGN KEY ",

This also copies over the mutation search docs from Pathoplexus to the Loculus docs.\nIt unfortunately doesn't seem to possible to have a server-side redirect in .mdx, so I had to create .astro files instead. This means that we have to delete these files on the Pathoplexus-side again because .astro files preceed .mdx files. @theosanderson, do you think that's a reasonable solution?\nThe search form help button and the link to the authentication API docs now point to the Loculus docs. The variables are in separate files so that they can be easily overwritten by Pathoplexus. Here is a PR for Pathoplexus: pathoplexus/pathoplexus#281\nThis also copies over the mutation search docs from Pathoplexus to the Loculus docs.\nPR Checklist\n\n\n[ ] All necessary documentation has been adapted.\n[ ] The implemented feature is covered by an appropriate test.",

    "body": "Adding new metadata fields to the values.yaml causes an issue because metadata fields that was processed by prepro prior to the addition of the field does not contain the new field. The data is stored in the database and then sent to LAPIS/SILO without processing. With the new config they expect the new metadata field that does not exist.\nThe backend needs to be prepared for this case. It's designed to validate that processed data can be imported by SILO. So it should also catch the case when the config changes:\n\nThe backend could process data it sends to LAPIS/SILO and add in null fields, or LAPIS/SILO prepro could do this apon data retrieval. Such a change would mean the backend would not need to store fields with null - this could be removed from prepro and save on storage cost.\nIt could throw an error that we handle in the SILO import job - indicating that /get-released-data needs to wait for reprocessing, this would require us to wait for the preprocessing pipeline updates (when we bump the version) to rollout.\n\nOriginally posted by @fengelniederhammer and @anna-parker in #2945 (comment)",

The new module structure and API focuses on three core principles:\n\n\nruntime compatibility (adding support for Deno, Cloudflare Workers, Bun, and other Web API interoperable runtimes)\ntree-shakeability (bundles should not contain features that don't end up being used)\nless options (removing support for processing deprecated response types, cutting down on the number of combinations that need to handled)\n\nTo that end openid-client@6 no longer supports the full cartesian matrix of response types and response modes, it no longer supports issuing encrypted assertions, decrypting assertions is limited to only a few algorithms, it no longer supports Dynamic Client Registration or Management, and Self-Issued OpenID Provider responses are also not supported.\nThe new API makes basic setups simple while allowing some degree of complexity where needed.\n\n\n...

There is no reason that we need to restrict the use of this backend call. Allowing it to be called for sequences in other states will allow its use for a revision form.\nAfter merging this it is now possible to access the \"edit page\" for released sequences in ones group by manually constructing a URL like https://allow-get-original-data-f.loculus.org/dummy-organism/submission/edit/LOC_0003CRZ/1 but the form doesn't work yet for submitting\nIn due course we should:\n\nmake this page display differently depending on whether the sequence is unreleased (editing) or released (revising)\nmake the page call the right backend for revising in that state\n(or we could also actually create separate pages - in which case we could add validation on the status to each of those pages)\n\nBut I don't think we need to couple these in this PR: merging this PR doesn't really lead to a broken state as the broken pages aren't accessible without constructing a URL.",

    "body": "In flowbite-react 0.10.2 the DatePicker was changed, changing the type of the value from just Date to Date | null.\nWe use this DatePicker for the UI to select the restriction end date for sequences. It is used once in the sequence upload, and also in the detailed sequence view, where you can edit the data use terms. In both cases a date must be there.\nSome ideas I have for how to deal with this:\nA) The clear button is not there, and so the value cannot be cleared, only changed to a different one, so null cannot appear anyways, so we do nothing.\nB) even though technically a null value should not be settable, in the onChange handler we somehow stop the null value from being set, and instead set a default value again, then no more downstream changes should be needed.\nC) even though technically a null value should not be settable, we just allow it to be set, and have the restrictedDate also be nullalbe in teh dialog, but the 'save' button is disabled if no value is set.\nD) something else?\n\nsee infos here: https://github.com/themesberg/flowbite-react/pull/1190/files",

This was not intended, and now by default, all components will render as page partials: only the contents of the components without a page shell.\nTo render the component as a full-fledged Astro page, pass a new option called partial: false to renderToString() and renderToResponse():\nimport { experimental_AstroContainer as AstroContainer } from 'astro/container';\nimport Card from '../src/components/Card.astro';\nconst container = AstroContainer.create();\nawait container.renderToString(Card); // the string will not contain &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\nawait container.renderToString(Card, { partial: false }); // the string will contain &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n\n\nastro@4.16.5\nPatch Changes\n\n#12232 ff68ba5 Thanks @\u200bmartrapp! - Fixes an issue with cssesc in dev mode when setting vite.ssr.noExternal: true\n\n\n\n\nChangelog\nSourced from astro's changelog.\n\n4.16.6\nPatch Changes\n\n\n#11823 a3d30a6 Thanks @\u200bDerTimonius! - fix: improve error message when inferSize is used in local images with the Image component\n\n\n#12227 8b1a641 Thanks @\u200bflorian-lefebvre! - Fixes a case where environment variables would not be refreshed when using astro:env\n\n\n#12239 2b6daa5 Thanks @\u200bematipic",

It includes their official names, country codes and subdivision level. Fuzzywuzzy is another popular python library which matches strings using the Levenshtein distance (an edit distance algorithm), it can be modified to weight string matches higher when individual words in the string match.\nTakes INSDC geolocation string in format country: division\nReturns country and attempts to split division into geoLocAdmin1 and geoLocAdmin2.\n\nUse pycountry for official list of geoLocAdmin1 options and abbreviations\nAttempt exact match of division substring (split by \",\") to geoLocAdmin1\nAttempt exact match of division substring (split by \"\\s\" or \",\") to geoLocAdmin1 abbr\nAttempt fuzzy match of division substring (after removing common administrative_divisions substrings) to geoLocAdmin1\nIf no match, return division as geoLocAdmin2\n\nTests\n\nCan use comparison script in https://github.com/loculus-project/loculus/blob/show_geoloc_diffs/ingest/scripts/comparison.py to compare against main and augur curate\nHere you can see sorted tsv of what changes the two options will make:\n\nEbola-zaire: https://github.com/loculus-project/loculus/blob/show_geoloc_diffs/ingest/metadata_merged_ebola-zaire_unique.tsv\nWest-nile: https://github.com/loculus-project/loculus/blob/show_geoloc_diffs/ingest/metadata_merged_west-nile_unique.tsv\n\nPR Checklist\n\n\n Update version_comment field with previous geolocation information if changed due to fuzzy matching\n Add additional geoLocAdmin1 curation list for not caught cases e.g. Attica etc.",

    "title": "feat(ingest): Format ingested `country: division` into geoLocCountry, geoLocAdmin1, geoLocAdmin2 ",
    "body": "resolves #\n\npreview URL: https://format-country.loculus.org/\nSummary\n\nWe have mentioned in the past it would be good to break down NCBI's geoloc field. This is of the format: country: division, where division can normally be further split into geoLocAdmin1 and geoLocAdmin2.\nSadly the format of the division field is inconsistent. For example for the US some samples have state, city others city, state, yet others do not separate state with a , but   or use the abbreviation. This means to extract more specific details we will need to do string matching. It also became clear to me that NIH does not clean their sequences based on the common occurrence of Conneticut. Astrahan is another example of this. I have now added a list of common misspellings, potentially in future we could use fuzzy matching for this.\nI got chatgpt to write me up some nice yaml lists with all states/regions/provinces for countries where we have a lot of samples with geoLocAdmin1 information.\nBy default for unmapped countries I keep the mapping as is: division is mapped to geoLocAdmin1.\nFor mapped countries I put the state(region/province) in geoLocAdmin1 if the division matches the state (division must include the state name). I put the entire division string into geoLocAdmin2 as well - unless it is an exact match for the state, then I do not additionally add it to geoLocAdmin2 (to avoid duplication). If no state matches division I put the entire division string in geoLocAdmin2.\nPotential Alternatives\n\naugur curate: https://docs.nextstrain.org/projects/augur/en/stable/usage/cli/curate/apply-geolocation-rules.html, this appears to rely on having a division and location field, this can be generated with https://docs.nextstrain.org/projects/augur/en/stable/usage/cli/curate/parse-genbank-location.html - remains to see how well this will work when division is not in a standard format\nhttps://pypi.org/project/pycountry/ has all countries and region based on ISO standards, also has fuzzy matching - will ",

The tsv generated by the ncbi datasets cli from the raw jsonl does not correctly format authors- leading to the case where the string cannot be correctly parsed. To avoid this I change the ingest code to use the raw jsonl directly. This way we can format authors correctly, and have access to the raw data.\nFields that existed in the (renamed) tsv and not in the jsonl\nOf these fields only two were actually mapped to Loculus fields.

We should stop other rules if one fails.\nSummary\n\n\nCreate a new package called ena_deposition. One config is generated at startup, this uses defaults from the config/default.yaml and then overwrites additional config arguments from the passed config/config.yaml (as the snakefile did before). This reduces repetition as instead of one config for each rule, also there is now only one config and only one cli entry point.\nThe create_project,create_sample, create_assembly, trigger_submission and upload_external_metadata functions are run in parallel threads (instead of before being run in parallel snakemake rules) and use stop_event to stop all threads if one fails.\nTested that this works as intended on a preview by causing an Exception to be raised in the trigger_submission function thread - this lead to all other threads being stopped and the pod stopping and being restarted by kubernetes:\n\n13:33:20    DEBUG (  create_assembly.py: 455) - Checking state in ENA\nTask generated an exception: Testing threads stop!!!\nupload_external_metadata stopped due to exception in another task\ncreate_sample stopped due to exception in another task\ncreate_assembly stopped due to exception in another task\ncreate_project stopped due to exception in another task\n\nAdditional changes:\n\nsnakemake was removed as a dependency, this lead to xmltodict working differently than before. I needed to create a new class called XmlNone for the case when a field is intentionally left None in the dictionary, e.g. SEQUENCING_PROJECT in the xml below:\n\n<SUBMISSION_PROJECT>\n    <SEQUENCING_PROJECT/>\n    <ORGANISM>\n        <TAXON_ID>Test taxon</TAXON_ID>\n        <SCIENTIFIC_NAME>Test scientific name</SCIENTIFIC_NAME>\n    </ORGANISM>\n</SUBMISSION_PROJECT>\n\nAs I now specify the log level in main I do not create a custom logger object for each script but use ",

Ideally, there would be one set of publications per organism, to scope it correctly. We can then add these publications to the projects that we submit to ENA - this is a very common pattern and something we should eventually do to take full advantage of the available cross-linking.\nIt's also something we can already import from Genbank: many sequences/projects have papers listed already, so we could surface them in sequence view.",

    "body": "Adding new metadata fields to the values.yaml causes an issue because metadata fields that was processed by prepro prior to the addition of the field does not contain the new field. The data is stored in the database and then sent to LAPIS/SILO without processing. With the new config they expect the new metadata field that does not exist.\nIncreasing the prepro pipeline with a metadata field addition could resolve this or the backend could process data it sends to LAPIS/SILO and add in null fields, or LAPIS/SILO prepro could do this apon data retrieval. Such a change would mean the backend would not need to store fields with null - this could be removed from prepro and save on storage cost.",

LAPIS has the correct values - let's simply rely on that.\nThis assumes the following as correct:\n\nThe backend just stores the history (not the state) of data use terms.\ngetting the history from the backend for a sequence entry that has expired restricted use terms will still only show \"restricted\" entries\n\nWe now simply take the use terms from LAPIS, that means the calculation is done in a single place for search and display.\nScreenshot\n\nPR Checklist\n\n\n All necessary documentation has been adapted.\n The implemented feature is covered by an appropriate test.",

However, we do not want to increase the version of a sample if the only changes are due to our mapping.\nSuggestion\nHash ingested metadata earlier - preferably prior to any reformatting or mapping to Loculus metadata fields. This will initially cause a change of hashes and a version update (which we should probably revert), but afterwards we will not have to worry about fixing ingest metadata mappings, or using more insdc metadata fields.\nPotential side effects\nIf an insdc metadata field that we do not use in Loculus is updated this will still cause a version increase.",

Using dictionaries will likely enhance compression efficiency by an order of magnitude which is essential for scalability and general resource efficiency.\nOne can start off using simply the refseq as the dictionary, though it'd be better to use a diverse subset of sequences for the best compression ratios.\nIf using more custom dictionaries, one would want to store the dictionaries used in a separate table. For now using the ref seqs seems like the best tradeoff for simplicity and efficiency.",

    "body": "partially resolves #2724\n\npreview URL: http://add-count-in-header.loculus.org/\nSummary\nAs we send data in ndjson format, clients (such as the silo_import_job) have no way of knowing if the data they have received is complete or if the stream was interrupted early.\nTo fix this, /get-released-data adds header x-rowcount to the response with the total number of expected records in the accompanying stream.\nClients can then compare this number with the responseBody to see if they have received all records and discard/re-request in case the stream was aborted early.\nSmall caveat\n\nThe actual streaming is executed after getReleased is defined. This means the count calculated for the header and the results of the stream are not inside the same database transaction. This means that if the table was updated in between calculating the record and streaming there could be more records in the stream than expected from the header.\nsilo_import_job will not use the data received from get-released-data if x-total-records header and the actual record count do not match. Meaning it could take slightly longer for new sequences to appear in the database but this should be negligible.\nThis only causes a problem if the stream is cut off after exactly as many records as expected from the header. (e.g. count is 20, add one new sequence, stream should include 21 records, stream is cut off after record 20, client thinks stream completed successfully - but we lost an arbitrary sequence).\nPR Checklist\n\n\n All necessary documentation has been adapted.\n The implemented feature is covered by an appropriate test.\n Add zstd (and probably jq to the silo-preprocessing docker image) - jq is already there: GenSpectrum/LAPIS-SILO#574, update: I can install zstd after the container is set up, not very clean but this works\n Break stream locally and check that this still works as intended.\nTest locally by adding a Thread.sleep(1000) between stream iterations in streamAsNdjson and killing the backend mid-stream",

    "body": "resolves #2718, #702\n\npreview URL: https://restricted-data-consisten.loculus.org/\nSummary\n\n\nAdds a test that if data is submitted to the frontend with restricted status it will stay in this restricted status. In order to do this I add the option for the mocked prepro pipeline to process restricted data. Disclaimer: With our current e2e set up we cannot test this entire process. So I am actually just testing that if the prepro pipeline sends us restricted data we keep it restricted. The user sets a sequence to state restricted before we send it to the prepro pipeline and the e2e tests mock the entire interaction with the prepro pipeline. So in theory the prepro pipeline could just remove the restricted label and send us back open data and this test would not detect it.\nFix error that was flagged when running tests locally: Warning: Each child in a list should have a unique \"key\" prop\" is a valid error by adding a key to a map function.\nThe e2e tests do not actually include the preprocessing pipeline, I will create a new issue to address this.\n\nScreenshot\n\nPR Checklist\n\n\n Check if it is actually necessary to add a separate group for restricted data.\n Update docs",

    "body": "Our current deployment appears to be bistable: once CPU requirements go above a certain level which is surprisingly low, maybe 30-40%, the cluster enters a locked state where CPU usage goes to 100% and doesn't easily recover.\nThe reason, I think, involves argocd restarting failed containers (things like prepro/ingest fail when keycloak is down, we probably should not fail but log/error/notify - so as not to make the situation worse). Restarted containers require more CPU than running ones.\nWe should investigate what the major contributors to the runaway are. Possible mitigations:\n\nsimply make sure we don't exceed 30% CPU usage, limit preview deployments\nnotify if this locked state is detected (e.g. if CPU usage goes >80%), or if there are scheduling errors in events\nadd extra nodes\ngive production proper cpu request budgets so production is not affected by cpu starvation overall",

    "body": "First of all, amazing work! I've been hoping for something like this for quite some time!\nIt seems like users upload consensus sequences, which is standard at the moment, but is there any interest in adding support for client-side consensus sequence calling from raw or mapped reads using ViralWasm-Consensus?\n\nWeb App: https://niema-lab.github.io/ViralWasm-Consensus/\nSource Code: https://github.com/niema-lab/ViralWasm-Consensus/\nPaper: https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/40/1/btae018/7515252\n\nViralWasm-Consensus uses biowasm to run WebAssembly-compiled versions of tools like fastp, Minimap2, and ViralConsensus client-side in the user's web browser without any need for manual installation of any tools\nI can imagine having an upload interface where, if the user picks a FASTQ file, it automatically gets mapped to the viral reference genome and gets a consensus sequence called directly within their own browser, without any manual action on their part\nThe rationale for such functionality is to prevent/minimize bioinformatics errors from users (e.g. those seen in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic)",

We need to use the same index for both. As the nextclade qc is performed by prepro it makes sense to do that change there. We also modify the codon and nucleotide ranges to have an inclusive start and an inclusive finish. Additionally if the range only includes one codon or nucleotide, e.g. 21-22 we only add the first element e.g. 21. Currently left and right codon deletions are not added.\nScreenshot\n\nFor example for submissionId PP025040.1.L/PP025039.1.M/PP025038.1.S. Instead of",

For elements that are in the same stacking context, we are able to use z-index to put something on top but this does not work across contexts. And by default, due to the order of the elements, the header was below the main content on the z-axis and, therefore, elements within the main content, if they have a different context, will remain on top.

    "body": "I just spent a loooong time debugging a confusing issue on Pathoplexus. It manifested as the database sealed secret that couldn't be extracted as it appeared to be corrupt. It was very confusing because I could see the sealed secrets I had configured in values yaml and they hadn't changed. It turned out that what had happened was that we added a new key host to the database secret in the default values.yaml recently. That default values yaml doesn't use sealed secrets at all, it defines them in a raw format. But because that value hadn't been added to pathoplexus's values.yaml in any form, and because pathoplexus values.yaml redefines the database secret as a sealed secret, what ended up happening was that the sealed secrets controller attempted to extract the host key, merged in from the default values yaml, even though that had never been sealed. This was so confusing to debug that I want to avoid it ever happening again, so now we will store sealed secrets under encryptedData not data so that you cannot get merging of a sealed and unsealed secret.\nhttps://different-key-sealed-secr.loculus.org/",

Probably from the backend. I wasn't closing db updates (this would explain ~20-30 additional connections).\n\n\nIt also fixes an issue in the backend when merging external metadata with other metadata fields, an alternative solution could be:\n\n\ncreate or replace function jsonb_concat(a jsonb, b jsonb) \nreturns jsonb\nlanguage plpgsql\nimmutable\nparallel safe\nas $$\ndeclare\n    result jsonb;\nbegin\n    -- Merge the two JSON objects\n    result := a || jsonb_object_agg(key, \n                case \n                    when a->key is null or a->key = 'null' then b->key \n                    else a->key \n                end)\n                from jsonb_each_text(b) as elem(key, value);\n    return result;\nend;\n$$;\nand use this like:\ncase \n       when all_external_metadata.external_metadata is null then jsonb_build_object('metadata', (sequence_entries_preprocessed_data.processed_data->'metadata'))\n        else jsonb_build_object('metadata', (sequence_entries_preprocessed_data.processed_data->'metadata') || all_external_metadata.external_metadata)\n    end as joint_metadata\nScreenshot\n\nPR Checklist\n\n\n Confirm this works locally from uploading new sequences, getting the sequen",

Actions will now redirect to the route specified in your action string on success, and redirect back to the previous page on error. This follows the routing convention of established backend frameworks like Laravel.\nFor example, say you want to redirect to a /success route when actions.signup succeeds. You can add /success to your action string like so:\n<form method=\"POST\" action={'/success' + actions.signup}></form>\n\nOn success, Astro will redirect to /success.\nOn error, Astro will redirect back to the current page.\n\nYou can retrieve the action result from either page using the Astro.getActionResult() function.\nNote on security\nThis uses a temporary cookie to forward the action result to the next page. The cookie will be deleted when that page is rendered.\n\u26a0 The action result is not encrypted. In general, we recommend returning minimal data from an action handler to a) avoid leaking sensitive information, and b) avoid unexpected render issues once the temporary cooki",

Currently we would add new groups and keep old groups, potentially having ingested sequences twice with no warning for users that the metadata has been updated.\nThis PR adds code that will detect this edge case (grouping change) and provides code to add the new groups and revoke the old ones. As there is a potential risk of over-revocation we should only run the revoke rule under manual oversight so although the code is added here I have not added the revoke rule to the rule all . In a later PR: #2392 I will add code to send us an automated message if such a change is detected and then we can launch a job which runs this snakemake rule.\nThis PR also adds very basic unit tests to ensure that revise and revoke work as expected.\nScreenshot\n\nRan locally with test data (altering metadata to break grouping and cause revision)\n\nRevocation is successful:\n and new sequences are added.\nRevision is successful and version is updated:\n\n\nPR Checklist\n\n\n When run locally with engineered data (see data in test folder) this will revise and revoke sequences as desired.\n The implemented feature is covered by an appropriate test.",

    "body": "resolves #\n\npreview URL: https://ingest-cleanup.loculus.org/\nProblem\n\nCurrently when annotating a metadata field from INSDC as perSegment this needs to be updated in the values.yaml and the ingest default.yaml (by adding it to the segment_specific_fields section). This can lead to confusion. This also means that all organisms currently must have the same fields as perSegment.\nUsing the values.yaml as the source of truth for perSegment will make it easier to have different fields specified as perSegment for different organisms.\nAdditionally, we have a dummy config.yaml in the ingest pipeline which can be used when testing ingest but should actually be replaced by the output of the generate_local_configs script.\nSummary\n\nDo not hardcode segment_specific_fields for all organisms, but create this from the values.yaml, allowing different organisms to have different conditions.\nRemove the dummy config.yaml and fields that should come from the config from defaults\nFound error in configs: sra_run_accession and ncbi_protein_count need to be perSegment, but biosample and bioproject accession should be per sample/group => after discussion below we remove ncbi_protein_count entirely as unused and confusing.\nAs perSegment hash is used only by ingest internally add it in the ingest code.\n\nScreenshot\n\nPR Checklist\n\n\n Works locally\n Has no change in number of sequences ingested on main -> there is a duplication again but I think this is just the cronjob bug",

A separate file will be created for each data collection in your project based on your collections defined in src/content/config.ts using a library called zod-to-json-schema.\nThis feature requires you to manually set your schema's file path as the value for $schema in each data entry file of the collection:\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"../../../.astro/collections/authors.schema.json\",\n  \"name\": \"Armand\",\n  \"skills\": [\"Astro\", \"Starlight\"]\n}\nAlternatively, you can set this value in your editor settings. For example, to set this value in VSCode's json.schemas setting, provide the path of files to match and the location of your JSON schema:\n{\n  \"json.schemas\": [\n    {\n      \"fileMatch\": [\"/src/content/authors/**\"],\n      \"url\": \"./.astro/collections/authors.schema.json\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\nIf you were pr",

This function will continuously (in a loop) scan for new sequences where a sample needs to be created and trigger their creation. It will also update both the submission_table and the assembly_table.\nIn contrast to create_project and create_sample we need to use the webin-cli.jar for assembly submission. This had to be added to the docker image (and its dependencies).\nIn contrast to create_project and create_sample we also need to wait for assemblies to be approved and only then we will receive the assembly accessions: https://ena-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submit/assembly/genome.html#assigned-accession-numbers This means there is one additional state in the assembly_table: WAITING.\nIt also adds some basic unit tests for sub-functions used by create_assembly.\n\nHigh level overview of assembly_creation:\nIn a loop:\n\nGet sequences in submission_table in state SUBMITTED_SAMPLE\n\n\nif (there exists an entry in the sample_table for the corresponding (accession, version)):\n-- if (entry is in status SUBMITTED): update submission_table to SUBMITTED_ASSEMBLY.\n-- else: update submission_table to SUBMITTING_ASSEMBLY.\nelse: create assembly entry in assembly_table for (accession, version).\n\n\nGet sequences in submission_table in state SUBMITTING_SAMPLE\n\n\nif (corresponding assembly_table entry is in state SUBMITTED): update entries to state SUBMITTED_ASSEMBLY.\n\n\nGet sequences in assembly_table in state READY, prepare files: we need chromosome_list, fasta files and a manifest file, set status to WAITING\n\n\nif (submission succeeds): set status to WAITING and fill in results: ena-internal \"erz_accession\"\nelse: set status to HAS_ERRORS and fill in errors\n\n\nGet sequences in assembly_table in state WAITING",

    "body": "I downloaded some metadata and noticed that the download file name was rather undescriptive: details.tsv. It's so generic that it causes duplication issues, e.g. in my case I already have 17 details.tsvs, so it ended up as details (18).tsv\nOne approach I find useful in practice is to use timestamped URLs. Anything is better than the current situation, though.\nOff the top of my head, this might work well:\nDOMAIN_ORGANISM_DATATYPE_DATETIME.EXTENSION\n\nWhere DOMAIN could be something like loculus, or pathoplexus, maybe this could be configured in values.yaml.\nORGANISM is obvious.\nFiletype is good to have, e.g. metadata or sequences or aligned. Datetime could include minutes, or even seconds, to completely avoid duplicates.\nExtra things we could possibly embed in file name:\n\nnumber of records included\nopen only, vs. restricted included\n...\n\nI don't think we need to be very stable here, people shouldn't rely on exact filenames - this is more for convenience. We could possibly allow users to set filenames themselves if they are picky, maybe LAPIS supports that already?",

    "body": "@corneliusroemer I think you looked into this already but thought I would make an issue as I couldn't find the solution. (Also its easier for my PR description).\nWhen we have submission errors or are stuck in status submitting_project for too long it would be nice to have a way to check if ENA has already received our post request. Then we could update our DB with the results and avoid submitting multiple times to ENA.\nThis might not be a blocker as today I realized ENA blocked me from submitting the same project.xml twice - so they do have some checks in place. But would still be nice to have. Also I am not sure if we can always count on them identifying duplications for samples and sequences.",

As each Element is completed, it is\nemitted via a Stream or Iterator interface. Elements returned will be complete with all their children, and an\n(empty) next sibling, if applicable. Elements (or their children) may be removed from the DOM during the parse,\nfor e.g. to conserve memory, providing a mechanism to parse an input document that would otherwise be too large to fit\ninto memory, yet still providing a DOM interface to the document and its elements. Additionally, the parser provides\na selectFirst(String query) / selectNext(String query), which will run the parser until a hit is found, at which\npoint the parse is suspended. It can be resumed via another select() call, or via the stream() or iterator()\nmethods. 2096\nDownload Progress: added a Response Progress event interface, which reports progress and URLs are downloaded (and\nparsed). Supported on both a session and a single connection\nlevel. 2164, 656\nAdded Path accepting parse methods: Jsoup.parse(Path), Jsoup.parse(path, charsetName, baseUri, parser),\netc. 2055\nUpdated the button tag configuration to include a space between multiple button elements in the Element.text()\nmethod. 2105\nAdded support for the ns|* all elements in namespace Selector. 1811\nWhen normalising attribute names during serialization, invalid characters are now replaced with _, vs being\nstripped. This should make the process clearer, and generally prevent an invalid attribute name being coerced\nunexpectedly. 2143\n\nChanges\n\nRemoved previously deprecated internal classes and methods. 2094\nBuild change: the built jar's OSGi manifest no longer imports itself. 2158\n\nBug Fixes\n\nWhen tracking source positions, if the first node was a T",

At the moment, my understanding is that if someone updates a particular segment, that segment will have a new release date and that will trigger it to go under a new loculus accession. That specific aspect will hopefully be fixable by #2171 .\nBut IMO there's a broader thing we should aim towards which is just that all versions of a particular segment should ideally always be under the same Loculus accession grouping. There may potentially be edge cases where this isn't possible but I still think it's a good thing to keep in mind and to monitor.",

None of the logs showed any of this. By looking at the code, I figured that I probably run into the first error case. Actually it's a configuration issue and not a user issue, so I would expect that I see this somewhere in some logs.\nAlso I was hoping that the function could concatenate arbitrary values, but instead it concatenates values with the accession version. It would be great if this was a little more general and preprocessing functions could pick from user-supplied metadata and from loculus-internal metadata arbitrarily. Are you planning to integrate this? We would like to remap the loculus-internal metadata at some point, there it would be nice to have it for all functions.\nPlease check whether this is valid Python syntax.

    "body": "Prompted by @fengelniederhammer struggling to ingest mpox due to high memory demand.\nI long wanted to implement this but never  got to it. Turns out it's quite easy, but I didn't want to fall victim to premature optimisation in the past.\npreview URL: https://stream-hash.loculus.org\nSummary\n\nConvert sequences.json to sequences.ndjson so one can stream-output it better\nStream sequences whenever they are used in Python scripts, rather than loading them all into memory. Due to Python memory overhead, we were easily requiring at peak 2x more memory than the size of the sequences file. For mpox this was at least 4GB, for SARS-CoV-2 this would be 500+ GB, for those use cases we definitely need to stream.\n\nSeems to work for all organisms:\n\nI tested memory usage of mpox and it's gone down to <100MB, from >4GB!",

This can also theoretically work with subdomains, with backend.pathoplexus.loculus.org. However we were running out of certificates with all our preview instances so we created a wildcard certificate for *.loculus.org. You cannot create a wildcard certificate with two wildcards (*.*.loculus.org) and so we have adopted a strategy where we instead use a pattern like authentication-pathoplexus.loculus.org for preview instances. However for the main pathoplexus instance we want to revert to authentication.pathoplexus.org so this PR adds a configurable value subdomainSeparator that can be set to - or . as we wish.",

This release page lists all changes made to the project during the beta. For the migration guide, please refer to the documentation.\n\ud83d\udea8 Breaking Changes\n\nSimplify mock function generic types and align with jest - by @\u200bhi-ogawa in vitest-dev/vitest#4784 (a0c1d37)\nRemove --segfault-retry - by @\u200bsheremet-va in vitest-dev/vitest#5514 (ed60e)\n\nThis flag was introduced to combat threads segfaults. Our current recommendation is to use the new default forks pool instead.\n\n\nRun suite hooks in a stack - by @\u200bsheremet-va in vitest-dev/vitest#5609 (1277d)\n\nThis feels like a more sensible default. Especially with the new onTestFinished hook. This can make your tests run a little bit slower.\n\n\nEnable coverage.ignoreEmptyLines by default - by @\u200bAriPerkkio in vitest-dev/vitest#5543 (31994)\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f This change may cause significant differences in your coverage results compared to Vitest v1. These changes are expected as coverage reporting is now more accurate. See vitest-dev/vitest#5423 for more details.\n\n\nAdd correct location and snapshot fields in json reporter - by @\u200bsheremet-va in vitest-dev/vitest#5434 (bcccc)\n\nPreviously, the location field pointed to the error location instead of the test location. Now it is aligned with jest and contains the line and column of a test function, but requires includeTaskLocation to be enabled.\n\n\nUpdate dependency chai to v5 - by renovate[bot] and @\u200bsheremet-va in vitest-dev/vitest#5135 (73646)\nRemove watchExclude - by @\u200bpatak-dev in vitest-dev/vitest#5177 (d7371)\nChange default pool t",

If a new segment is added to the group the new submissionId will contain another INSDC Id and thus will not be found by reingest. This means that we will keep the old segment group and create a new segment group containing one more segment. The old segments will have two accessions in loculus. This should be easy to fix with a change to the compare_hashes.py script - as we get a list of all INSDC submissionIds associated with a sample when we query loculus.",

The problem with this is that the backend will reject requests including a sequence without required fields (if they are not in an error state) - which means all other sequences in that request will also be rejected - so we are currently missing a lot of sequences on main.\nThis PR adds back the required field to the prepro configs and it modifies prepro to put sequences without required fields in an error state.\nScreenshot\nInstead of merging this PR we could also remove the required flag from  sample_collection_date. Making sample_collection_date required has the largest effect on the number of sequences in loculus, this was pre making it required - I found a preview from before I merged the last PR: https://isodates.loculus.org/ But if we nolonger make sample_collection_date required we then we need to update the metadata docs:",

I think that it would be better to only count HAS_ERRORS+AWAITING_APPROVAL as \"awaiting review\" and count RECEIVED+IN_PROCESSING as \"in processing\".\n\nFor now, the current solution is fine in my opinion and I am happy for this PR to be merged because we expect the processing to be very fast for Pathoplexus. But for instances where the processing pipeline can be slow, it is important to distinguish and I think that we should create an issue if it is not implemented in this PR.\nOriginally posted by @chaoran-chen in #2204 (comment)",

This allows us to keep the sql table version files in a folder inside the ena-submission folder.\n\nAfter initialization is complete the pod runs\n\nsnakemake get_ena_submission_list: For the moment this just calls the get-released-data endpoint for data in state APPROVED_FOR_RELEASE.

I try to run ingest in a pod by running:\n../deploy.py cluster --dev\n../deploy.py helm --dev --enablePreprocessing --enableIngest\n\nI first realized that there was an issue with the kubernetes/loculus/templates/ingest-config.yaml file, it was incorrectly still sending requests to loculus main. I changed this to send requests to the local host, i.e. I modified from\n{{- $backendHost := .Values.environment | eq \"server\" | ternary (printf \"https://backend-%s\" $.Values.host) ($testconfig | ternary \"http://localhost:8079\" \"http://loculus-backend-service:8079\") }}\n{{- $keycloakHost := .Values.environment | eq \"server\" | ternary (printf \"https://authentication-%s\" $.Values.host) ($testconfig | ternary \"http://localhost:8083\" \"http://loculus-keycloak-service:8083\") }}\n\nto\n{{- $backendHost := .Values.environment | eq \"server\" | ternary (printf \"https://backend-%s\" $.Values.host) \"http://localhost:8079\" }}\n{{- $keycloakHost := .Values.environment | eq \"server\" | ternary (printf \"https://authentication-%s\" $.Values.host) \"http://localhost:8083\" }}\n\nI see that the requests are now going to the local host, but are still refused, e.g. in the logs I see\nrequests.exceptions.ConnectionError: HTTPConnectionPool(host='localhost', port=8083): Max retries exceeded with url: /realms/loculus/protocol/openid-connect/token (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPConnection object at 0xffff8e0db290>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 111] Connection refused'))\n\nI checked that the user insdc_ingest_user exists and still can log in with the dummy password. However, the group insdc_ingest_group does not exist and even if I make it it somehow does not persist. Could this be the problem?\nUpdate: the group gets created when we submit sequences so this is just a side effect of the connection being refused. Most likely the issue is somewhere else.

After a lot of experimenting and discussing with @fengelniederhammer and @JonasKellerer last week it appears best to use the ktlint CLI and apply stricter formatting to avoid further confusion.\nThis is the result of using ktlint --editorconfig=.editorconfig --format to format the backend. As a side note this is very similar to the default intellij IDE formatting when I apply Reformat Code to the entire folder (that also applies changes to all files in the same way except at 3 single locations - I assume there is some difference in the intellij defaults vs the ktlint defaults).",

    "body": "Currently there is a hard constraint on all grouped segmented pathogens that the ncbi_release_date and the ncbi_update_date must be the same for all segments.\nTo allow different dates we need to:\n\nFix prepro: Either allow date concatenation e.g. segment1:date1/segment2:date2... or take max/min date - for update date this is a quick fix.\nFix ingest/reingest: This is primarily important for ncbi_release_date. Reingest checks the hash of each segment group by recalculating the submissionId of that group, which is comprised of the concatenated INSDC Ids of the grouped segments. If a new segment is added to the group the new submissionId will contain another INSDC Id and thus will not be found by reingest. This means that we will keep the old segment group and create a new segment group containing one more segment. The old segments will have two accessions in loculus. This should be easy to fix with a change to the compare_hashes.py script - as we get a list of all INSDC submissionIds associated with a sample when we query loculus.",

    "body": "resolves #2078, #643\n\npreview URL: https://backend-add-external-meta.loculus.org/\nSummary\n\nThis PR:\n\nCreates an external_metadata table in the backend, when filled the contents of the externalMetadataColumn are concatenated with the contents of the processedMetadata column in the the sequence_entries_view and given in a new field called joint_metadata - this metadata field is then returned when  get-released-data is called and thus displayed on the webpage.\nAdds the role external_metadata_updater to keycloak.\nCreates a submit-external-metadata endpoint. It requires the organism, the name of the external submitter e.g. ENA and a ndjson object which includes the external metadata. The following rules apply:\n\n\nGiven sequence entries must exist (identified by the column 'accession' in the metadata file)\nThe user is authorized to use this endpoint, i.e. user is a member of external_metadata_updater role\nThe last accession version is in status  'APPROVED_FOR_RELEASE', i.e. can be released externally\nexternal metadata meets validation requirements: correct type, missing/required fields are correct - this is defined in the config (only external metadata that has the field externalSubmitter equal to the externalSubmitter set in the call will be checked).\nIf any of above is not fulfilled, this will return an error and roll back the whole transaction.\n\n\nUpdates the backend_config template to add an external_metadata field to the backend config. This field is the same as the metadata field except that it contains an additional field externalMetadataUpdater. This is currently set to ena by default however the backend uses this value when verifying the external metadata.\n\nPR Checklist\n\n\n All necessary documentation has been adapted.\n The implemented feature is covered by an appropriate test.\n Figure out why tests run ok on their own but fail when run using ./gradlew test.\n Modify backend config to have a separate metadata field for external metadata\n Make sure authorization for e",

    "body": "preview URL: https://prepro-fix.loculus.org/\nFixes\nIn #2100 I mentioned that there is a bug in the prepro code when processing multi-segment nextclade alignments.\nWhen all segments are merged:\n\nWhen the L segment is uploaded individually:\n\nBasically these alignment metrics need to be annotated as per_segment.\nSummary\n\nThe PR allows us to have metadata fields that were created by nextclade also per_segment. In order to do this the per_segment parameter must also be added as a field to the preprocessing arguments. For example:\n\n- name: total_unknown_nucs\n        type: int\n        header: \"Alignment states and QC metrics\"\n        noInput: true\n        rangeSearch: true\n        per_segment: true\n        preprocessing:\n          args: { type: int, per_segment: true }\n          inputs: { input: nextclade.totalMissing }\n\n\nI then adjusted the prepro code to use this argument when updating the metadata fields.\nThis PR also cleans up the prepro file a bit by moving some functions to another script as prepro is getting a bit too large.\n\n\nScreenshot",

    "title": "Add transactional submission logic to backend: Avoid submission race condition causing duplicates",
    "body": "Occasionally, a race condition happens (unlikely in production but possible) when 2 ingests run in parallel and submit the sequences after having queried existing submissions before the other one submitted:\nThe sequence could be like:\n\nA gets previous submissions: None\nB gets previous submissions: None\nA submits all, since all are new\nB submits all, since it also thinks all are new\n\nThe reason is that a) getting previous submissions and b) submitting is not atomic/a single transaction, there's a delay (usually small, but can be big if a pipeline hangs/system overloaded etc.)\nAn easy way to fix this is to allow the pipeline to use a timestamp when it got the previous submissions, and submit that timestamp with the submission. The backend would then reject the submission if there has been a more recent submission, after the original timestamp.\nAll this would require is:\n\nfor the backend to set a timestamp \"timestamp_of_start_most_recent_submission\", and update it whenever the submit endpoint is hit\nthe backend would return this timestamp whenever ingest asks for previous submissions\ningest would submit that returned timestamp to the backend together with submissions\nthe backend would reject the submission if the timestamp values are not identical\n\nRight now, ingest assumes that this race condition never happens, so it ends up crashing once the race condition has happened. While we could try to work around it in ingest, the cleanest way is for the backend to implement the above transaction logic. Ingest can't undo submissions, so the best is for backend to offer transactions like this.\nWhile it might seem that this feature is only useful to the special submitter \"ingest\", as ingest uses the normal public API for submission, this feature would help anyone who programatically submits to Loculus and wants to ensure they don't publish duplicates.\nI label this a bug and an enhancement, because there is no way that a submitter can avoid this race condition with the current A",

    "body": "When I showed our kubernetes resource usage to Richard, he raised the good point that it is surprising that without any user interaction/load, we're using around 500 millicpus per instance.\nI had previously looked into this: the main cpu load (when not preprocessing, which only happens right after startup) is backend and database.\nMy gut feeling for what keeps them at around 250 mCPU each is that for each organism (which are 5 by default right now), we:\n\na) preprocessing asks whether there are any new sequences every few seconds (to keep processing start delay low)\nb) silo preprocessing downloads all sequences every 30 seconds\n\nIt would be simple to find out what the impact of each is by simply tuning the request frequency and plotting load against the frequency (this should give a straight line with the slope showing the average load per request per second).\nI'm sure we could easily reduce the background usage significantly without sacrificing silo/preprocessing responsiveness. It's not a big priority right now but we should eventually tackle it.\nIdeas\n\nSilo load can be reduced by having SILO preprocessing submit a timestamp in the header saying when it last received data from the backend. The backend would keep track of the last time of modification of the \"data_for_release\" view, and can decide whether there's been new data. If no, it can reply with \"no change\" to SILO preprocessing. There's a bit of care required for making sure that every relevant change causes an update of the \"last_change\" timestamp in the backend, but this shouldn't be too hard. Simple logic (though with false positives): \"whenever the database makes changes to a subset of the tables preprocessing and submission, it updates the last \"release_data_timestamp\" after the change transaction has completed.\nThere's nothing to preprocess if: since the last request to preprocess, there haven't been any changes to the preprocessing and submission tables. Looks like the same timestamp might be usable h",

This means adding 1-2 tables to the backend and and 2+ endpoints.\nNote that in order to submit to ENA we require:\n\na unique project (this will be linked to the group metadata) - with its own accession value (actually ENA produces 2 accessions but they can be used interchangably)\na unique sample (this will be linked to the sequence metadata) - with its own accession value\nand then finally we will need to submit the actual sequence data (an analysis in ENA with its own unique accession) using these two(+) accession values.\n\nIdeally, we will create 2 tables in our postgres DB mapping:\n\neach loculus group accession to its insdc_submission_status  and project/study accession value in insdc\neach loculus sequence accession to its insdc_submission_status for the metadata, the sample accession and insdc_submission_status for the the sequence and the analysis accession value.\n\nProbably we would like to have the status fields: PENDING, PROCESSING, COMPLETED and FAILED.\nWe might also want to store the number of attempts.\nThe Kotlin code\n\nSend Values in Parallel (coroutines is an option for this) to the submit pod which will upload to ENA (most likely a python wrapper which will forward values to ENA) and use Concurrency Control: Use database transactions (Postgres should handle this) or row-level locking to ensure that no two processes or threads pick up the same item from the table at the same time:\n\nval response = client.sendAsync(request, HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofString()).await()\n\nMake sure processing is Idempotent: If the same request is sent multiple times, it should only be seen in ENA once - we will probably need to handle this in the submission wrapper (i.e. the submission pod)",

This may be because I'm totally computational, but I'm not sure why splitting those categories out is helpful, and whether a \"sample/specimen type\" might be less confusing?\n\"Breadth of coverage\" is confusing to me - maybe \"depth threshold\" might be clearer?\nIt'd be great if there was something to put whether the the genome is from culture or not - eg in dengue, lots of NCBI genomes have been cultured in mosquito cells (whereas ours normally come straight from the clinical sample), but this is free text in genbank so very hard to currently remove these genomes",

With time, it has become clear to me that it is based on nucleotide number, and by including the mutating nucleotides (eg g327t) I could get to a mutation of interest.\n(2) Results include partial sequences not spanning region of interest.\nHowever, if I just type in 327 (to look at the loci of interest) I will also be given all of the partial sequences that do not have any nucleotide listed at that site (for WNV this means I see 995 partial sequences without the loci of interest and 1 with the g327t mutation).\n(3) Can only search by nucleotides.\nFor my work with WNV, and much of the literature, we work primarily with the amino acid changes and not the nucleotides that caused them. Having a way to search by amino acids would be very useful instead of having to go back and find what nucleotides correspond to what amino acids (especially when amino acid switches could be made through multiple nucleotide changes).",

It should\nalso minimize certificate load time on Windows systems when using a Python\nversion built with OpenSSL 3.x. (#6667)\nRequests now supports optional use of character detection\n(chardet or charset_normalizer) when repackaged or vendored.\nThis enables pip and other projects to minimize their vendoring\nsurface area. The Response.text() and apparent_encoding APIs\nwill default to utf-8 if neither library is present. (#6702)\n\nBugfixes\n\nFixed bug in length detection where emoji length was incorrectly\ncalculated in the request content-length. (#6589)\nFixed deserialization bug in JSONDecodeError. (#6629)\nFixed bug where an extra leading / (path separator) could lead\nurllib3 to unnecessarily reparse the request URI. (#6644)\n\nDeprecations\n\nRequests has officially added support for CPython 3.12 (#6503)\nRequests has officially added support for PyPy 3.9 and 3.10 (#6641)\nRequests has officially dropped support for CPython 3.7 (#6642)\nRequests has officially dropped support for PyPy 3.7 and 3.8 (#6641)\n\nDocumentation\n\nVarious typo fixes and doc improvements.\n\nPackaging\n\nRequests has started adopting some modern packaging practices.\nThe source files for the projects (formerly requests) is now located\nin src/requests in the Requests sdist. (#6506)\nStarting in Requests 2.33.0, Requests will migrate to a PEP 517 build system\nusing hatchling.

See full details in the MDX optimization documentation.\nMost Starlight users should be unaffected, but if you are using MDX files outside of Starlight pages with the components prop, you may see issues. You can disable optimization by adding MDX manually to your integrations array in astro.config.mjs:\nimport { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';\n+ import mdx from '@astrojs/mdx';\nimport starlight from '@astrojs/starlight';\n// https://astro.build/config\nexport default defineConfig({\nintegrations: [\nstarlight({\ntitle: 'My docs',\n// ...\n}),\n\n\n  mdx(),\n\n],\n});\n\n\n\n#1735 1a9ab50d Thanks @\u200bHi",

That works for now while it's easy to access the database, but in production it will be laborious to go into the database.\nSo it would be nice to have an endpoint that summarizes the current status of preprocessing pipeline.\nIn fact, we could just have a dump of relevant database tables (read only) and without personally identifiable data - this would make debugging easy while still upholding privacy.\nThis endpoint would be restricted to the \"superuser\" (for instance) but not limited to debug builds, as this endpoint would be very useful in production as well.\nOriginally posted by @corneliusroemer in #1922 (comment)",

Adding the segmented option means that the metadata item is different for each segment. Thus, the config files will create #(segments) metadata items, each with the segment name concatenated to the end of the name, i.e. name_segment.\n\n\nUpdate preprocessing pipelines: take multi segmented input.\n\n\n\nresolves #1915\n\npreview URL: https://ccfv.loculus.org/cchf/search\nScreenshot\n\n\nPR Checklist\n\n\n Get the nextclade_datasets to work with docker -> nextstrain/nextclade_data#199\n Modify ingest pipeline further: properly hash for multiple segments, join segments based on isolate and join metadata correctly.\n Make sure that all config files are correctly generated, fix some small bugs: get segments from config directly, make sure that displayNames are correctly modified\n Fix reingest bug\n Fix website sequence tab box bug\n Refactor ingest to only merge groups after processing metadata\n Fix preprocessing config file: instead of adding segmented field generate dictionary with renamed fields (like in other configs)\n Upload ref sequences to corneliusroemer/seqs to avoid values.yaml getting too large\n All necessary documentation has been adapted.\n The implemented feature is covered by an appropriate test. -> moved to a later PR",

Call getNextException to see other errors in the batch.\n\nI'm not sure if this is just a test error, or this shows that our backend can end up in a bad state that we haven't noticed yet in manual testing. Would be good to investigate at some point. As far as I'm aware, the E2E tests don't have any special privileges with regards to the backend, so such a state could also be entered by real users.\nTo reproduce:\n\nFire up an E2E cluster\nRun npx playwright test \"pages/review/index.spec.ts\" --repeat-each=10\nObserve\n\nIt seems enough to just run lots of review tests in parallel to trigger this state.

Babel and esbuild transformations are removed, which should result in faster build times. The refactor requires using Astro v4.8.0 but no other changes are necessary.\n\n\n#10935 ddd8e49 Thanks @\u200bbluwy! - Allows integrations after the MDX integration to update markdown.remarkPlugins and markdown.rehypePlugins, and have the plugins work in MDX too.\nIf your integration relies on Astro's previous behavior that prevents integrations from adding remark/rehype plugins for MDX, you will now need to configure @astrojs/mdx with extendMarkdownConfig: false and explicitly specify any remarkPlugins and rehypePlugins options instead.\n\n\n#10935 ddd8e49 Thanks @\u200bbluwy! - Renames the optimize.customComponentNames option to optimize.ignoreElementNames to better reflect its usecase. Its behaviour is not changed and should continue to work as before.\n\n\n#10935 ddd8e49 Thanks @\u200bbluwy! - Replaces the internal remark-images-to-component plugin with rehype-images-to-component to let users use additional rehype plugins for images\n\n\nPatch Changes\n\n\n#10935 ddd8e49 Thanks @\u200bbluwy! - Simplifies plain MDX components as hast element nodes to further improve HTML string inlining for the optimize option\n\n\n#10935 ddd8e49 Thanks @\u200bbluwy! - Allows Vite plugins to transform .mdx files before the MDX plugin transforms it\n\n\n#10935 ddd8e49 Thanks @\u200bbluwy! - Updates the optimize option to group static sibling nodes as a <Fragment />. This reduces the number of AST nodes and simplifies runtime rendering of MDX pages.\n\n\n#10935 ddd8e49 Thanks @\u200bbluwy! - Tags the MDX component export for quicker component checks while rendering\n\n\n#10935 ddd8e49 Thanks @\u200bbluwy! - Fixes export const components keys detection for the optimize option\n\n\n#10935 ddd8e49 Thanks @\u200bbluwy! - Improves optimize ",

Playwright would otherwise click buttons in HTML without the react event handlers attached which made tests flaky: in particular locally where things are faster than in CI\nUses data-testid for elements/buttons that are hard to get from Playwright otherwise\nGet rid of unnecessarily tight timeout (1s) in seqset test (default is 5s)\nAdd npm run script e2e:ui that opens playwright GUI mode with headed playwright: this makes it particularly easy to debug tests and see why they fail (extensively used in the preparation of this)\n\nScreencast\nThis shows that server side rendered react has certain buttons disabled (they become interactive once React has hydrated)\n\nShow outdated screencast\n\n\nSome discussions around here: https://loculus.slack.com/archives/C05G172HL6L/p1715207927290729",

However, the sequenceName is still in the mutationBadge component and when the mutations are copied the sequenceNames are still appended to the front of the mutation: i.e. GP:A83V GP:T263A... additionally, the page can be searched with appended sequenceName.\n\nScreenshot",

    "body": "The problem\nCurrently we do not handle the case when a user uploads sequences to NCBI and to loculus. We do not handle the case when the sequence is uploaded to NCBI first and then to loculus or when the sequence is uploaded to loculus and then the user still uploads to NCBI.\nCurrent State of Ingest\nCurrently, ingest handles sequence uploads to NCBI as follows:\n\nFor cases where the sequence is uploaded first to NCBI: The ingest pipeline uses sequence metadata which includes the NCBI accession ID and other NCBI upload related information to identify sequences in NCBI and add them to loculus.\nFor cases where the sequence is uploaded to loculus first and then to NCBI by us: We plan to keep a list of loculus accession IDs with the corresponding NCBI accession ID - this should prevent us from reingesting sequences that we have uploaded. (Alternatively we could update our loculus metadata with NCBI upload information so that the sequence in NCBI will be recognized by our hash function as corresponding to our sequence).\n\nProblem Scenarios\n\n\nAssume now a user uploads to NCBI and then to loculus (which might happen when users test our service):\nIn theory if a user first uploads to NCBI and is able to properly add these metadata fields to loculus we will not reingest the sequence from NCBI, however if anything is not correct then the sequence will be flagged as different by us and we will try to reingest a new sequence. Both will be associated with the same NBCI accession ID... which might create problems. Additionally, even if the user is able to properly upload the sequence so that we will not reingest it from NCBI - it will not be in our accession ID list and we will try to reupload it to NCBI.\n\n\nAssume now a user uploads to loculus and then NCBI (which might happen when users test our service):\nLoculus will upload the sequence aswell - as this sequence will now have a different upload time and upload user NCBI will see this as a separate sample - this might have serious i",

This used to be a string, but is now an object.\nIf you are relying on config.title (for example in a custom <SiteTitle> or <Head> component), you will need to update your code. We recommend using the new siteTitle prop available to component overrides:\n---\nimport type { Props } from '@astrojs/starlight/props';\n// The site title for this page\u2019s language:\nconst { siteTitle } = Astro.props;\n\n\n#1613 61493e55 Thanks @\u200bHiDeoo! - Adds new draft frontmatter option to exclude a page from production builds.\n\n\n#640 7dc503ea Thanks @\u200bHiDeoo! - Updates the default line-height from 1.8 to 1.75. This change avoids having a line height with a fractional part which can cause scripts accessing dimensions involving the line height to get an inconsistent rounded value in various browsers.\nIf you want to preserve the previous line-height, you can add the following custom CSS to your site:\n:root {\n\t--sl-line-height: 1.8;\n}\n\n\n#1720 749ddf85 Thanks @\u200bjacobdalamb! - Updates astro-expressive-code dependency to the latest minor release (0.35) and exposes a new @astrojs/starlight/expressive-code/hast module for users who need to use Expressive Code\u2019s version of hast.\nThis includes a potentially breaking change if you use custom Expressive Code plugins.

In that case, we should figure out how to handle this.\nThe specific use-case I know about is for HIV - if one has quite a fragmented sequence that has been aligned to a whole-genome reference, it will have a lot of gaps. Apparently if there are enough gaps, INSDC wants the fragments to be submitted as separate fragments, rather than as a whole-genome submission.\nFor that use-case, one possible solution is to break into fragments on our side and submit to ENA like that. However, we'd then need to remember to record and link to multiple INSDCs from our own record.\nWe should also be aware and log any other cases where we encounter instance where sequences we accept may be rejected by INSDC, so we can handle those, too.\n(Not for Initial Phase)",

These new utilities abstract away some of the boilerplate code that is common in toolbar apps, and lower the barrier of entry for app authors.\nFor example, instead of creating an event listener for the app-toggled event and manually typing the value in the callback, you can now use the onAppToggled method. Additionally, communicating with the server does not require knowing any of the Vite APIs anymore, as a new server object is passed to the init function that contains easy to use methods for communicating with the server.\nimport { defineToolbarApp } from \"astro/toolbar\";\nexport default defineToolbarApp({\ninit(canvas, app, server) {\n\napp.addEventListener(\"app-toggled\", (e) => {\n\n console.log(`App is now ${state ? &quot;enabled&quot; : &quot;disabled&quot;}`);.\n\n\n});\n\n\napp.onToggled(({ state }) => {\n\n   console.log(`App is now ${state ? &quot;enabled&quot; : &quot;disabled&quot;}`);\n\n\n});\n\n\nif (import.meta.hot) {\n\n import.meta.hot.send(&quot;my-app:my-client-event&quot;, { message: &quot;world&quot; });\n\n\n}\n\n\nserver.send(\"my-app:my-client-event\", { mess",

These new utilities abstract away some of the boilerplate code that is common in toolbar apps, and lower the barrier of entry for app authors.\nFor example, instead of creating an event listener for the app-toggled event and manually typing the value in the callback, you can now use the onAppToggled method. Additionally, communicating with the server does not require knowing any of the Vite APIs anymore, as a new server object is passed to the init function that contains easy to use methods for communicating with the server.\nimport { defineToolbarApp } from \"astro/toolbar\";\nexport default defineToolbarApp({\ninit(canvas, app, server) {\n\napp.addEventListener(\"app-toggled\", (e) => {\n\n console.log(`App is now ${state ? &quot;enabled&quot; : &quot;disabled&quot;}`);.\n\n\n});\n\n\napp.onToggled(({ state }) => {\n\n   console.log(`App is now ${state ? &quot;enabled&quot; : &quot;disabled&quot;}`);\n\n\n});\n\n\nif (import.meta.hot) {\n\n import.meta.hot.send(&quot;my-app:my-client-event&quot;, { message: &quot;world&quot; });\n\n\n}\n\n\nserver.send(\"my-app:my-client-event\", { message: \"world\" })\n\n\nif (import.meta.hot) {\n\n import.meta.hot.on(&quot;my-server-event&quot;, (data: {message: string}) =&gt; {\n\n\n\n   console.log(data.message);\n\n\n\n });\n\n\n}\n\n\nserver.on<{ message: string }>(\"my-server-event\", (data) => {\n\n console.log(data.message); // data is typed using the type parameter\n\n\n});\n},\n})\n\nServer helpers are also available on the server side, for use in your integrations, through the new toolbar object:\n\"astro:server:setup\": ({ toolbar }) => {\n  toolbar.on<{ message: string ",

At the same time, I get a CORS error for the same request.\nMy hypothesis is that something in front of the backend is aborting the request before the backend does it and returns the error. While it does, it does not set the right CORS headers as the backend would.\nAs part of the ticket, we should:\n\nIdentify whether anything is interrupting the request and fix it if that's the case.\nMake sure that the CORS headers are properly set.",

When kubernetes is deployed (loculus/deploy.py) the metadata is converted into two jsons: the 'website_config.json' and the 'backend_config.json'. 'website_config.json' is read into the frontend in loculus/website/src/config.ts and the metadata is added to the schema. Prior to showing the metadata on the webpage (loculus/website/src/components/SequenceDetailsPage/DataTable.astro)  the metadata in the schema component is further processed into a tabledata: loculus/website/src/components/SequenceDetailsPage/getTableData.ts.\nThe schema (and the tabledata) is used at various other sections of the frontend and backend. So changes to the structure of the schema and metadata will not just affect the display of the metadata (i.e. schema.metadata is used for searching for specific sequences) but also other portions of the code.",

    "body": "Reviewing #1599 I got the feeling that we're not very explicit about which (types of) users are authorized to do what for various endpoints.\nI've never worked on anything authorization related, so I really don't know the best practices, but I'm wondering if there's a way to make it more explicit for each endpoint what the authorization requirements are.\nIf we don't document it in code, it's easy that we mess something up when we refactor and we don't want to leak data to people who are not supposed to have it - it's more sensitive than other types of bugs.\nRight now auditing is tricky. While I think that processing endpoints are only allowed to be called by a specific user, I don't see this documented in Swagger at all.\nDiscussion on Slack: https://loculus.slack.com/archives/C05G172HL6L/p1713273242036109",

    "body": "preview URL: https://feat-mutation-badges.loculus.org/seq/LOC_000001Y.1\nSummary\nAdd mutation badge React components for nuc and aa mutations.\nThis is a simplified version of what's there in Nextclade or Covariants. I had to port it from styled-components to tailwind.\nBadge segments are colored dynamically, depending on a character or gene name. I use style attr to handle that.\nAdditionally, the text is being rendered of light or dark color depending on the contrast ratio relative to background color. I had to add polished NPM package to calculate contrast ratio.\nNotes:\n\n\nThere is no fixed list of genes/CDSes avaialble, so it's not immediately possible to render stable (recognizable) gene/CDS colors, which may increase readablity of aa badges significantly. In Nextclade the list is provided from \"backend\" and then gene index in the list is used to select color from a fixed list of colors (with index wrap on overflow), and in Covariants the list is static, as it only deals with SC2. In both cases, color palette is taken from nextstrain.org \"Nucleotide diversity of genome\" panel, as something we are the most accustomed to in Nextstrain organization. In Loclulus I decided to use color hash algorithm to generate colors from gene name strings for now. If backend could provide this data, then UX could be further improved.\n\n\nIt seems that DataTable.astro is only able to render values that are strings or numbers. I don't immediately see how the badges can be incorporated there without hacks. I need a bit more details of what's planned for this component. So for now I just temporarily added some hardcoded badges above the table as a showcase.\n\n\nFrom a quick look, I found that backend currently provides mutations in string format, e.g. A123G. This means that these strings need to be parsed in order to extract gene, position, and ref and query characters. In Covariants this is done using regex like that. It's a bit of a hairy adventure though. So if backend could precompute and",

Few points for discussion:\n\n Why are aminoAcidInsertions (and nuc ones) included at all? We can include them but it's more related to alignments rather than metadata proper. After all we don't include snps, or deletions. Insertions allow the reconstruction of a sequence from alignments, but that's all.\n If aminoAcidInsertions and (nuc ones) null? It seems we use null for not provided, should we use that or rather use something like N/A? null seems to be simply the default in kotlin.\n submittedAt and released at is a unix timestamp, should we rather serialize it as human readable timestamp, something like 2023-01-05Z23:11:56?",

Previously, a pages/404.astro or pages/[...catch-all].astro route had to match to allow middleware. This is now not necessary.\nWhen a route does not match in SSR deployments, your adapter may show a platform-specific 404 page instead of running Astro's SSR code. In these cases, you may still need to add a 404.astro or fallback route with spread params, or use a routing configuration option if your adapter provides one.\n\n\n#9960 c081adf998d30419fed97d8fccc11340cdc512e0 Thanks @\u200bStandardGage! - Allows passing any props to the <Code /> component\n\n\n#10102 e3f02f5fb1cf0dae3c54beb3a4af3dbf3b06abb7 Thanks @\u200bbluwy! - Adds a new experimental.directRenderScript configuration option which provides a more reliable strategy to prevent scripts from being executed in pages where they are not used.\nThis replaces the experimental.optimizeHoistedScript flag introduced in v2.10.4 to prevent unused components' scripts from being included in a page unexpectedly. That experimental option no longer exists and must be removed from your configuration, whether or not you enable directRenderScript:\n// astro.config.mjs\nimport { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';\nexport default defineConfig({\nexperimental: {\n\n\n  optimizeHoistedScript: true,\n\n\n\n\n\n  directRenderScript: true\n\n}\n});\n\nWith experimental.directRenderScript configured, scripts are now directly rendered as declared in Astr",

But it does all this sequence set up in a global set up and then downstream a separate user is created for each browser tested. Then each browser tested does its own stuff. But in the current set up I believe it isn't easy for those browsers to each have a sequence in their own group for them to act on (e.g. to be able to click the revoke or revise buttons). I also find the whole E2E set up quite hard to understand.\nWe should figure out how to make testing these possible with our E2E. And relatedly also ideally how to make our E2E more truly E2E - following a sequence through from submission to review to release, which I don't think we really do atm.",

It might make sense to add a third one: info to indicate stuff that's not a problem but might still be of interest to the submitter.\nRight now, the lowest severity level is a warning which might be to severe for things that are just informational. E.g. we may well have a button to \"submit everything with neither warnings nor errors\" which would mean we would annoy users by attaching warnings that are not a problem.\nI really like the tooltips for the review page and it'd be neat if we could take full advantage here.\nThis is where this info would show up:",

If they are still there, it might not be too difficult to tack them on to the sequence review page and make them show in tooltips/as markup somehow.\nThis is definitely post-MVP but it could be a quite nice feature!\nWhat do others think? @chaoran-chen @theosanderson @emmahodcroft & co?\nI.e. my idea is to somehow present the warnings also in this public view:\n\nhttps://demo-prepro.loculus.org/mpox/seq/PP_000001Y.2\nEssentially the warnings are contextual metadata on metadata.",

This is presumably because Astro is behind a reverse proxy and doesn't know it is SSL protected (although a header from Traefik should tell it that). We can probably fix this by setting base in Astro config (but we'd have to do that at build time).\nBut regardless, the issue is that this is sent as the redirect_uri to Keycloak, and so keycloak redirects, with tokens, go to http and not https. We can hack it to go to https by using replace(\"http://\", \"https://\") in our JS that redirects to keycloak. BUT when we do that log in doesn't work and our logs say\n\"instance\":\"LoginMiddleware\",\"level\":\"error\",\"message\":\"Keycloak callback error: OPError: invalid_grant (Incorrect redirect_uri)\",\"timestamp\":\"2024-02-23T20:50:25.409Z\"}\n\nI.e. keycloak doesn't like this https URI, it only wants http.

    "body": "I noticed in #1005 that when a search query is submitted as POST [very long queries >1800 characters, see #967] the entire search state is lost after submission. This is undesirable, the search state should be kept.\nThis might require backend changes, for example returning the state in the response.\nI've prioritized as post-MVP for now as the search feature still works with this issue and it's probably not a very common use case. But could also be classified as MVP (public)",

This wasn't easy to test before the code changes here.\nI also add a --dry-run feature to ./deploy.py to make it easiert to see what commands it executes.

If each additional compression method is extra effort, I'd start with .zst, then add .gz and .xz.\nThis is definitely not urgent and something for well post-MVP\nBut it could also pay off for certain use cases like storing all public SARS-CoV-2 sequences. These are uncompressed around 150-200GB at the moment, which even with 1Gbps uplink would take half an hour.\nAllowing compression would also save ingress costs.",

    "title": "Make ability to submit dependent on having allowlisted email domain or admin approval or rate limit",
    "body": "A public loculus instance that sends data to INSDC must be able to authenticate users somehow - we cannot allow anonymous submissions. Otherwise anyone on the internet can submit sequences to INSDC and upload garbage.\nIn discussion with @bh-ethz  and @chaoran-chen  we discussed two options:\na) Email allowlist: certain domains allow us to identify users, e.g. university email addresses. If someone signs up with such an email address and they confirm ownership of the email address this should be sufficient trust to allow them to submit.\nb) For users who do not have an email address on the allowlist, admins can give manual approval\nGiven the current setup, where we give accessions as soon as a submitter starts the submission, we should not allow even that step for anonymous accounts, as we can otherwise run out of accessions. This could be softened if we had a way to rate limit anonymous accounts, e.g. allow submission of at most 100-1000 sequences without being approved for submission (via allowlist or manually).\nA rate limit is probably not a bad idea in general, even for users who are allowlisted. Depending on a pathogen, there's a clear max size of submission that should be very unlikely to ever be exceed. E.g. it's unlikely anyone will ever submit more than 10k mpox sequences, given there are only 7.5k sequences on Genbank. The issue with a rate limit is that it does require quite some extra backend work, whereas an allowlist should be straightforward.",

For example, prior to this release, the following code did not apply changes:\nJwtBuilder builder = Jwts.builder();\nbuilder.audience().add(\"an-audience\"); // no .and() call\nbuilder.compact(); // would not keep 'an-audience'\nNow this code works as expected and all other NestedCollection instances like it apply changes immediately (e.g. when calling\n.add(value)).\nHowever, standard fluent builder chains are still recommended for readability when feasible, e.g.\nJwts.builder()\n    .audience().add(\"an-audience\").and() // allows fluent chaining\n    .subject(\"Joe\")\n    // etc...\n    .compact()\nThese same notes are repeated in the CHANGELOG, and as always, project documentation is in the README.\nPlease allow 30 minutes from the time this announcement is published for the release to be available in Maven Central.\n\n\n\nChangelog\nSourced from io.jsonwebtoken:jjwt-api's changelog.\n\n0.12.5\nThis patch release:\n\n\nEnsures that builders' NestedCollection changes are applied to the collection immediately as mutation methods are called, no longer\nrequiring application developers to call .and() to 'commit' or apply a change.

This is a default and can be overridden with a custom ObjectMapper if desired.\nPassword-based JWE encryption key algorithms (PBES2_HS256_A128KW, PBES2_HS384_A192KW and PBES2_HS512_A256KW) now enforce an upper bound (maximum) number of iterations allowed during decryption to mitigate against potential DoS attacks. Many thanks to Jingcheng Yang and Jianjun Chen from Sichuan University and Zhongguancun Lab for their work on this!\n\nA number of other issues fixed: thread-safe ServiceLoader usage for dynamic JSON processor lookup, Android enhancements for JSON Reader APIs, fixed Elliptic Curve field element padding, and more.  Please read the 0.12.4 CHANGELOG for full details of all of these changes, and as always, project documentation is in the 0.12.4 README.\nPlease allow 30 minutes from the time this announcement is published for the release to be available in Maven Central.\n\n\n\nChangelog\nSourced from io.jsonwebtoken:jjwt-api's changelog.\n\n0.12.4\nThis patch release includes various changes listed below.\nJackson Default Parsing Behavior\nThis release makes two behavioral changes to JJWT's default Jackson ObjectMapper parsing settings:\n\n\nIn the interest of having stronger standards to reject potentially malformed/malicious/accidental JSON that could\nhave undesirable effects on an application, JJWT's default ObjectMapper is now configured to explicitly reject/fa",

    "body": "Sometimes, we would like to update and rerun the pre-processing pipeline (due to new clade designations, improvements, adding new fields, etc.). Here's a proposal for the implementation:\n\nThe backend has a current_preprocessing_version and a staging_preprocessing_version.\nThe administrator can start reprocessing by setting a new staging_preprocessing_version.\nWe add the following columns to the sequence_entries table:\n\npreprocessing_pipeline_version - Stores the pipeline version of processed_data\nstaging_processed_data, staging_errors, stating_warnings, staging_preprocessing_pipeline_version\n\n\nWhen calling the /extract-unprocessed-data endpoint, the preprocessing pipeline has to state its version. The endpoint also returns data if the version is the staging_preprocessing_version and the sequence has not been reprocessed.\nWhen a preprocessing pipeline submits preprocessed data through /submit-processed-data, it must also state its version. Based on the version, the data is stored either in the \"production\" fields or in the staging fields.\nIf a new preprocessing pipeline reports an error for a sequence that has already been released, the administrator (and the curators?) gets a notification. It is not possible/safe to release the reprocessed data until the issue has been resolved.\nOnce the new preprocessing pipeline has caught up and all sequences in the Awaiting_approval or Approved_for_release state are processed by the new version, the content in the staging fields gets swapped in.\n\nWhat do you think about this approach? Do you think that we need to implement it before the MVP launch or can it be added afterwards? (I'm in favor of adding it afterwards.)",

    "body": "Pathoplexus will be two things:\n\nan instance of Loculus, providing a database\na social/political project which needs: pages about governance, documentation, policies, funding, etc.\n\nThe latter are not part of loculus, but will be housed on a shared website. We need some way of allowing this. I previously raised this in https://github.com/orgs/loculus-project/discussions/112 but I think it's reaching the point of being worth an Issue.\nMy own view is that we really want to allow ourselves quite a bit of flexibility in the Pathoplexus-specific pages. I would like the option to e.g. embed a Twitter widget for example, and to have photos of the Governance people. And I'd really like to keep open the possibility of arbitrary HTML, to e.g. have a Nextstrain build or something.\nI've come to the conclusion that the best way to do this is to have the pathoplexus website have its own Docker image. We would have a repo which would contain a website directory which would simply be copied on top of the loculus website directory and then be built as an image. This directory would contain only the pathoplexus-specific pages (and potentially subpages used as includes).\nI'm happy to implement this in Feb - just wanted to capture the issue while we're in the mode of capturing Issues. Open to discussion if people don't like this way of going about it, but I do think it has the fewest drawbacks.",

Endpoint (2) would take our accession+version and insdc_upload_status, insdc_accession, and potentially insdc_upload_errors.\nNew submission vs revision and revocation\nShould endpoint (1) only return entirely new sequences or also sequences that were revised or revoked? Or do we want to have separate endpoints to extract revised and revoked sequences that are ready for upload?\n(cc @corneliusroemer)",

Please follow the Migration guidelines to upgrade. This release took a lot of effort to make, and I expect a bit of that effort on your part while upgrading. Most of the changes are mechanical, and a simple Find/Replace All will get you a long way. For the rest of it, you will learn how to handle requests and responses using the standard JavaScript API. Thank you!\n\nBreaking changes\n\nDrops support for Node.js 16. Please upgrade to Node.js 18 or later to use the global Fetch API.\nDrops support for TypeScript < 4.7.\nAll browser-side exports, like setupWorker, SetupWorkerApi, etc., must be imported from msw/browser now.\nRenames the rest object to http (rest.get -> http.get).\n\n\nResponse resolver call signature is no longer (req, res, ctx) => res() but instead ({ request }) => new Response().\n\n\nThe following exports are removed due to no longer being needed:\n\nresponse\ncontext and related exports (defaultContext, restContext, graphqlContext).\ncompose and createResponseComposition\n\n\nres.once() is removed in favor of the { once: boolean } option on the req",

    "title": "Backend multi-pathogen support",
    "body": "This is to discuss how we can support multiple pathogens on the backend side. Originally (at the very beginning of the project), I thought that we might want to launch one instance of the backend per pathogen (just as we do with SILO/LAPIS). Now, considering the architecture of our backend, I think that this doesn't make sense and that it would be easy to add multi-pathogen support.\nURLs\nI assume that there won't really be a need to request or submit data of different pathogens in one request. For example, we don't expect/won't want to allow users to make submissions that contain sequence entries of different pathogens. Also, each preprocessing pipeline will probably be dedicated to only one pathogen. Thus, I suggest having the pathogen name as a path parameter:\n/{pathogen}/submit\n/{pathogen}/extract-unprocessed-data\n...\n\nConfig\nI am not sure how to best design a configuration system and organize configuration files. Just one thought inspired by Nginx/LaTeX/...: In Nginx, there is one (root) config file - (usually) nginx.conf (see example file), and it can include individual files or whole directories. There are common structures such as having one config file per site but in principle, everything can also be written in a single config file. Is that maybe a good approach for us going forward?\nDatabase\nInternally, we only need to add a column pathogen to the sequences table.\nWhat's the primary key then? See below.\nAccession\nOption 1: Sequence entries across pathogens within an instance share the same accession space.\nOption 2: Sequence entries of different pathogens have separate accession spaces. They could have different prefixes.\nIn favor of option 1:\n\nA prefix stands for the instance and helps people to recognize an instance.\nIt avoids having a lot of different prefixes.\nIt is what INSDC do.\n\nIn favor of option 2:\n\nPeople can recognize the pathogen from the prefix.\nNot sure if this is relevant.. It would make it easier to merge instances that hold different patho",

Please follow the Migration guidelines to upgrade. This release took a lot of effort to make, and I expect a bit of that effort on your part while upgrading. Most of the changes are mechanical, and a simple Find/Replace All will get you a long way. For the rest of it, you will learn how to handle requests and responses using the standard JavaScript API. Thank you!\n\nBreaking changes\n\nDrops support for Node.js 16. Please upgrade to Node.js 18 or later to use the global Fetch API.\nDrops support for TypeScript < 4.7.\nAll browser-side exports, like setupWorker, SetupWorkerApi, etc., must be imported from msw/browser now.\nRenames the rest object to http (rest.get -> http.get).\n\n\nResponse resolver call signature is no longer (req, res, ctx) => res() but instead ({ request }) => new Response().\n\n\nThe following exports are removed due to no longer being needed:\n\nresponse\ncontext and related exports (defaultContext, restContext, graphqlContext).\ncompose and createResponseComposition\n\n\nres.once() is removed in favor of the { once: boolean } option on the request handler.\nReplaces the .printHandlers() method with .listHandlers().\nRemoves the NetworkError class in favor of the standard Response.error().\nMoves request error handling from the worker thread to the client thread.\nChanges the call signature of the Life-cycle Events API to accept a single object argument.\nUses crypto.randomUUID() instead of Math.random() in the worker.\nFor the full list of changes and detailed instructions on how to upgrade please see the Migration guidelines.\n\nFeatures\n\nAdopts Fetch API primitives. Represent intercepted requests and mocked responses as Request and Response instances respectively.\nSupports Node.js v18.\nSupport",

One can also argue it should just redirect to the latest version.)\n/seq/[sequence_id].version (shows specific version)\n/seq/[sequence_id].fa or /seq/[sequence_id].[version].fa provide Fasta output.

I'm putting both together because they are largely coupled, especially since the way we model it in SILO directly determines the user experience for API users.\n(Background: The implementation of revision/revocation in the backend is described here: https://github.com/pathoplexus/pathoplexus/blob/3abbd9f7168feaad110c0fb99a59290788eede7f/backend/docs/runtime_view.md#revision)\nHere's my proposal:\nFeatures:\n\nOn the details page of a sequence, if there is a newer version of the sequence, the user should see a note saying that there is a newer version and linking to the newest version.\nOn the details page of a sequence, if there is a newer version of the sequence and the newest version is a \"revocation entry\", the user should see a note saying that the sequence was revoked and linking to the newest version.\nOn the details page of a sequence, if it is a \"revocation entry\", the page should show the revocation date.\nNot sure: What do we show on the details page of a sequence, if there is a newer version of the sequence that is a \"revocation entry\" but the newest version is not a \"revocation entry\"? I.e., if the sequence was revoked and then unrevoked? Proposal: This is a very rare case and for simplicity, we don't add special handling and let it be covered by (1): i.e., we just link to the newest version but don't mention revocation.\nThe search only queries the latest versions and non-revoked data.\nThrough the API/bulk download, people can get all revisions and revocation entries. People should be able to see when a sequence was revised and revoked (and unrevoked).\n\nIn SILO, we have the following special columns:\n\n\nsequenceIdWithVersion - the primary key\n\n\nsequenceId\n\n\nversion\n\n\nisRevocation - indicates that this is a revocation entry.

Please follow the Migration guidelines to upgrade. This release took a lot of effort to make, and I expect a bit of that effort on your part while upgrading. Most of the changes are mechanical, and a simple Find/Replace All will get you a long way. For the rest of it, you will learn how to handle requests and responses using the standard JavaScript API.

Please upgrade to Node.js 18 or later to use the global Fetch API.\nDrops support for TypeScript < 4.7.\nAll browser-side exports, like setupWorker, SetupWorkerApi, etc., must be imported from msw/browser now.\nRenames the rest object to http (rest.get -> http.get).\n\n\nResponse resolver call signature is no longer (req, res, ctx) => res() but instead ({ request }) => new Response().\n\n\nThe following exports are removed due to no longer being needed:\n\nresponse\ncontext and related exports (defaultContext, restContext, graphqlContext).\ncompose and createResponseComposition\n\n\nres.once() is removed in favor of the { once: boolean } option on the request handler.\nReplaces the .printHandlers() method with .listHandlers().\nRemoves the NetworkError class in favor of the standard Response.error().\nMoves request error handling from the worker thread to the client thread.\nChanges the call signature of the Life-cycle Events API to accept a single object argument.\nUses crypto.randomUUID() instead of Math.random() in the worker.\nFor the full list of changes and detailed instructions on how to upgrade please see the Migration guidelines.\n\nFeatures\n\nAdopts Fetch API primitives.

A better approach (closer to what the real deployment would look like) is probably one where each of these containers are their own deployment. But in order for these containers to be in their own deployment but to link up properly one would want them to be in their own namespace. The problem with having them in their own namespace was that we need a secret to pull images from GHCR, and I didn't figure out how to inject that secret into each namespace. We should do that injection with sealed secrets - the secret will be stored in the open on GitHub but in a totally safe encrypted form.",

For example:\nBefore:\n<code class=\"astro-code\" style=\"background-color: #24292e\">\n  <pre>\n    <span class=\"line\" style=\"color: #e1e4e8\">my code</span>\n  </pre>\n</code>\nAfter:\n<code class=\"astro-code\" style=\"background-color: #24292e; color: #e1e4e8\">\n  <pre>\n    <span class=\"line\">my code<span>\n  </pre>\n</code>\nThis does not affect the colors as the span will inherit the color from the parent, but if you're relying on a specific HTML markup, please check your site carefully after upgrading to verify the styles.\n\n\nPatch Changes\n\nUpdated dependencies [2993055be, c4270e476, bd5aa1cd3, f369fa250, 391729686, f999365b8, b2ae9ee0c, 0abff97fe, 3bef32f81]:\n\nastro@3.3.0\n\n\n\nastro@3.3.0\nMinor Changes\n\n\n#8808 2993055be Thanks @\u200bdelucis! - Adds support for an --outDir CLI flag to astro build\n\n\n#8502 c4270e476 Thanks @\u200bbluwy! - Updates the internal shiki syntax highlighter to shikiji, an ESM-focus",

    "body": "Here are my thoughts:\nDefinitions\n\nSequence ID: a sequence-specific identifier that Pathoplexus assigns\nRevision: the version number of a sequence+metadata\nUnpreprocessed data: the data that the submitter provides\nPreprocessed data: the data that the preprocessing pipeline provides/derives based on the unpreprocesed data\n\nThere are three \"regular\" top-level submitter operations: submit, revise, and revoke:\nWhen a user submits data, they send unpreprocessed data. For each sequence, Pathoplexus creates a new row in the \"sequences\" table. It generates a new sequence ID. The revision number of the sequences is 1.\nWhen a user revises data, they send sequence IDs and unpreprocessed data. For each revised sequence, Pathoplexus creates a new row in the \"sequences\" table. It does not change any existing rows and does not create new sequence IDs. The new rows have an incremented revision number. A sequence can only be revised if it has the SILO_READY status (see below).\nWhen a user revokes data, they send sequence IDs. For each revoked sequence, Pathoplexus creates a new row in the \"sequences\" table. The unpreprocessed data are empty. The \"revoked\" flag is set to true. The new rows have an incremented revision number. A sequence can only be revoked if it has the SILO_READY status (see below).\nExample:\nGiven the following events:\n\nSubmit [{data: d1}, {data: d2}] -> ids: 1, 2\nRevise [{id: 1, data: d3}]\nRevoke [{id: 1}]\n\nThe \"sequences\" table would look as follows:\n\n\n\nSequence ID\nRevision\nRevoked\nUnpreprocessed data\n\n\n\n\n1\n1\nfalse\nd1\n\n\n2\n1\nfalse\nd2\n\n\n1\n2\nfalse\nd3\n\n\n1\n3\ntrue\n\n\n\n\nThe preprocessing pipeline runs for every entry where unpreprocessed data is not empty and adds preprocessed data, warnings, and errors.\n\n\n\nSequence ID\nRevision\nRevoked\nUnpreprocessed data\nPreprocessed data\nWarnings\nErrors\n\n\n\n\n1\n1\nfalse\nd1\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n2\n1\nfalse\nd2\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n1\n2\nfalse\nd3\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n1\n3\ntrue\n\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n\nWhen we update our preprocessing pipeline (e.g., when new UShER or Nextclade",

The log file location is hardcoded in this case.\n\n\nfor the client: an POST-endpoint is created where client-logs can be send to. These logs will be appended to the local file\n\n\ndeploying via docker locally works as expected. (docker build -t website . && DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME=website docker-compose up)\n\nDeployment on netlify breaks since they deploy serverless functions and the simple approach (plain old log-files) cannot work.\nI left the hardcoded log folder as is, but this breaks the admin endpoint on netlify.\n\n\n\nhttps://develop.sentry.dev/self-hosted/ would be an alternative, but is another service that has to be deployed and maintained. I have set up a self-hosted sentry instance. It comes with 24 different container (it starts a kafka, postgres, redis,...) and naively I would suggest our requirements for infrastructure would more than double",

    "body": "Currently, we configure the database in our docker compose file. The init script is inside the repository. This is not ideal since the deployment of pathoplexus would also need access to that script.\nInstead I propose to use a database migration tool like https://flywaydb.org/ to provision the database from within the Kotlin code. Pros:\n\nThe database setup is bundled within the backend service. A deployment thus only needs an empty database and the service that connects to it.\nAs some point after the release, we will need to change the database schema, so we need a way to migrate between schemas. This will handle it out of the box: Starting a newser version of the backend service will migrate an already running database with an old schema.",

The admin can/should (of course) limit the maximum size.\nSome thoughts:\n\nDo we want to be able to resume after a short connection disruption? Maybe we can use tus.io or resumable.js Not relevant for MVP.\nWhat are the compression formats that we should support? zip, zstd, gz, and xz?\nShould the user also be able to upload large uncompressed files? If they do, maybe we can compress them in the browser/CLI software first? Or do we (for now) simply reject large uncompressed files (e.g., above 1 GB)?\nWe need to have protection again zip bombs.\nThe implementation needs to be memory-efficient (we shouldn't hold multiple GBs of data in RAM for one upload).",

One limitation to Astro's existing approach has been that you could not dynamically use hoisted scripts. Each page received the same, all-inclusive bundle whether or not every script was needed on that page.\nNow, Astro has improved the static analysis to take into account the actual imports used.\nFor exam",

It also takes up the idea in #82 and made the search button (on desktop and on mobile) sticky and always visible.\n\nCode-wise, I extracted some code from the off-canvas navigation and created a useOffCanvas hook, an OffCanvasOverlay component, and a CSS class offCanvasTransform. Happy to receive feedback on whether this is a good way to reuse the code. I thought about creating a reusable OffCanvas component but didn't really know how.\nI didn't write any test for this PR. Regarding e2e tests, I suggest that we first wait for #63. We could test the useOffCanvas hook but as it is really simple, I'm not sure whether it is worth setting up something like react-hooks-testing-library (which itself recommends that simple hooks that are closely tied to a component should be simply tested with the components).",

This could include tools that use Pathoplexus data (ex: Nextstrain builds) but also tools that help people use Pathoplexus (other tools that can submit to Pathoplexus).\nThis could start out basic like a list of links, but could in future be made fancier, ex, divided by pathogen and with a search bar (and/or other ideas).\nThere should be an email address (and github edit link if it's a simple page) so people can easily request the addition of their own tool\nWe should come up with some guidelines about what we'd want to advertise. For example, do we just want to link to 'live' things (if so, what does this mean?), or are we open to people also linking to static analysis results/papers? Do we want to link to code that doesn't use Pathoplexus directly but enables its use, either on front or backend?",

We have decided to create an issue now for visibility and tracking purposes.\nIssue\nOn Thursday, 29th August, we identified and fixed a bug in a Loculus dependency, SILO (see loculus-project/loculus#2666). The bug meant that bulk downloads of unaligned nucleotide sequences from Pathoplexus were incorrect. The fix was rolled out to Pathoplexus in #60.\nSeverity:\nThis issue affected the endpoint for the download of bulk raw nucleotide sequences. It did not affect the sequences displayed on individual pages, the download of metadata or the download of bulk aligned sequences.\nImpact:\nThe estimated impact is low. Analytics show a small proportion of users accessed the Browse pages (which were not themselves impacted). Of users who access the Browse pages, a very small proportion make a download. If users were making downloads, we believe that they were likely doing so to test out the website functionality and that . The error was such that it would be clearly apparent in any analyses that were made. The bug was detected internally within the SILO team rather than being reported by users.\nDetails of the SILO bug can be found here: GenSpectrum/LAPIS-SILO#549",

For each accession we get the nucleotide insertions from LAPIS (using the nucleotideInsertions endpoint with a filter for accession). We then recreate the unaligned sequences from the aligned sequences and insertions. As insertions, unaligned and aligned sequences are all stored at a different location in LAPIS this is a good way to check for internal consistency. However, this test is very computationally intensive - so if we want to use it for production we should randonly select accessions to check.",

Todo:\n\n Figure out whether this will mean seqset creation is down: yes it will be down\n Add planned downtime notification for status.pathplexus.org\n Potentially disable seqset creation while it's down (possibly add this to Loculus as a feature)\n Potentially test what happens in a preview when crossref is down so we don't take down backend if we get errors etc\n\nThis has the latest details (hopefully): https://status.crossref.org/incidents/v3k2t9f3jdcw\nFull email we got:\n\nAs you know, we are working to move our main database to a new and open system. We will be completing the final steps of this work between Monday 16th September 21:00 UTC and Tuesday 17th September 21:00 UTC.\nDuring this time, there will be complete downtime and outage on the following Crossref services:\n\nDeposits, including helper tools like the Web Deposit Form\nQueries\nAdmin tool (doi.crossref.org)\nReports\nOAI-PMH\nOpenURL\nContent negotiation\n\nIf you attempt to access these services, including making a metadata deposit, you\u2019ll receive a 500 unavailable error message, and you will need to retry when these services are back online. We will not store or queue attempted metadata deposits or updates made during the downtime.\nCrossref DOIs will continue to resolve during this time. The REST API is not affected by this work and will remain available as normal.\nWe initiated the migration between 20 and 21 August, 2024 and made significant progress; we are now ready to complete the proces. We realise additional scheduled downtime may cause further disruption for you, but this is critical work to move forward to a more robust, reliable, and modern infrastructure. Thank you for your support.\nWe\u2019ll be keeping this maintenance alert on our status page up to date as the time approaches, but we wanted to give you as much advance notice as possible. You can subscribe to updates from that link.",
