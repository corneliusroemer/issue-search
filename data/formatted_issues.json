We can probably fix this by setting base in Astro config (but we'd have to do that at build time).\nBut regardless, the issue is that this is sent as the redirect_uri to Keycloak, and so keycloak redirects, with tokens, go to http and not https. We can hack it to go to https by using replace(\"http://\", \"https://\") in our JS that redirects to keycloak. BUT when we do that log in doesn't work and our logs say\n\"instance\":\"LoginMiddleware\",\"level\":\"error\",\"message\":\"Keycloak callback error: OPError: invalid_grant (Incorrect redirect_uri)\",\"timestamp\":\"2024-02-23T20:50:25.409Z\"}\n\nI.e. keycloak doesn't like this https URI, it only wants http. It is unclear to me how to fix that.",

I also find the whole E2E set up quite hard to understand.\nWe should figure out how to make testing these possible with our E2E.

Few points for discussion:\n\n Why are aminoAcidInsertions (and nuc ones) included at all? We can include them but it's more related to alignments rather than metadata proper. After all we don't include snps, or deletions. Insertions allow the reconstruction of a sequence from alignments, but that's all.\n If aminoAcidInsertions and (nuc ones) null? It seems we use null for not provided, should we use that or rather use something like N/A? null seems to be simply the default in kotlin.\n submittedAt and released at is a unix timestamp, should we rather serialize it as human readable timestamp, something like 2023-01-05Z23:11:56?",

While I think that processing endpoints are only allowed to be called by a specific user, I don't see this documented in Swagger at all.\nDiscussion on Slack: https://loculus.slack.com/archives/C05G172HL6L/p1713273242036109",

In that case, we should figure out how to handle this.\nThe specific use-case I know about is for HIV - if one has quite a fragmented sequence that has been aligned to a whole-genome reference, it will have a lot of gaps. Apparently if there are enough gaps, INSDC wants the fragments to be submitted as separate fragments, rather than as a whole-genome submission.\nFor that use-case, one possible solution is to break into fragments on our side and submit to ENA like that. However, we'd then need to remember to record and link to multiple INSDCs from our own record.\nWe should also be aware and log any other cases where we encounter instance where sequences we accept may be rejected by INSDC, so we can handle those, too.\n(Not for Initial Phase)",

Maybe we want to limit the things someone can place here as a username?

We do not handle the case when the sequence is uploaded to NCBI first and then to loculus or when the sequence is uploaded to loculus and then the user still uploads to NCBI.\nCurrent State of Ingest\nCurrently, ingest handles sequence uploads to NCBI as follows:\n\nFor cases where the sequence is uploaded first to NCBI: The ingest pipeline uses sequence metadata which includes the NCBI accession ID and other NCBI upload related information to identify sequences in NCBI and add them to loculus.\nFor cases where the sequence is uploaded to loculus first and then to NCBI by us: We plan to keep a list of loculus accession IDs with the corresponding NCBI accession ID - this should prevent us from reingesting sequences that we have uploaded. (Alternatively we could update our loculus metadata with NCBI upload information so that the sequence in NCBI will be recognized by our hash function as corresponding to our sequence).\n\nProblem Scenarios\n\n\nAssume now a user uploads to NCBI and then to loculus (which might happen when users test our service):\nIn theory if a user first uploads to NCBI and is able to properly add these metadata fields to loculus we will not reingest the sequence from NCBI, however if anything is not correct then the sequence will be flagged as different by us and we will try to reingest a new sequence. Both will be associated with the same NBCI accession ID... which might create problems. Additionally, even if the user is able to properly upload the sequence so that we will not reingest it from NCBI - it will not be in our accession ID list and we will try to reupload it to NCBI.\n\n\nAssume now a user uploads to loculus and then NCBI (which might happen when users test our service):\nLoculus will upload the sequence aswell - as this sequence will now have a different upload time and upload user NCBI will see this as a separate sample - this might have serious i",

Would be good to investigate at some point. As far as I'm aware, the E2E tests don't have any special privileges with regards to the backend, so such a state could also be entered by real users.\nTo reproduce:\n\nFire up an E2E cluster\nRun npx playwright test \"pages/review/index.spec.ts\" --repeat-each=10\nObserve\n\nIt seems enough to just run lots of review tests in parallel to trigger this state.

Having a way to search by amino acids would be very useful instead of having to go back and find what nucleotides correspond to what amino acids (especially when amino acid switches could be made through multiple nucleotide changes).",

This may be because I'm totally computational, but I'm not sure why splitting those categories out is helpful, and whether a \"sample/specimen type\" might be less confusing?\n\"Breadth of coverage\" is confusing to me - maybe \"depth threshold\" might be clearer?\nIt'd be great if there was something to put whether the the genome is from culture or not - eg in dengue, lots of NCBI genomes have been cultured in mosquito cells (whereas ours normally come straight from the clinical sample), but this is free text in genbank so very hard to currently remove these genomes",

    "body": "When I showed our kubernetes resource usage to Richard, he raised the good point that it is surprising that without any user interaction/load, we're using around 500 millicpus per instance.\nI had previously looked into this: the main cpu load (when not preprocessing, which only happens right after startup) is backend and database.\nMy gut feeling for what keeps them at around 250 mCPU each is that for each organism (which are 5 by default right now), we:\n\na) preprocessing asks whether there are any new sequences every few seconds (to keep processing start delay low)\nb) silo preprocessing downloads all sequences every 30 seconds\n\nIt would be simple to find out what the impact of each is by simply tuning the request frequency and plotting load against the frequency (this should give a straight line with the slope showing the average load per request per second).\nI'm sure we could easily reduce the background usage significantly without sacrificing silo/preprocessing responsiveness. It's not a big priority right now but we should eventually tackle it.\nIdeas\n\nSilo load can be reduced by having SILO preprocessing submit a timestamp in the header saying when it last received data from the backend. The backend would keep track of the last time of modification of the \"data_for_release\" view, and can decide whether there's been new data. If no, it can reply with \"no change\" to SILO preprocessing. There's a bit of care required for making sure that every relevant change causes an update of the \"last_change\" timestamp in the backend, but this shouldn't be too hard. Simple logic (though with false positives): \"whenever the database makes changes to a subset of the tables preprocessing and submission, it updates the last \"release_data_timestamp\" after the change transaction has completed.\nThere's nothing to preprocess if: since the last request to preprocess, there haven't been any changes to the preprocessing and submission tables. Looks like the same timestamp might be usable h",

    "body": "Occasionally, a race condition happens (unlikely in production but possible) when 2 ingests run in parallel and submit the sequences after having queried existing submissions before the other one submitted:\nThe sequence could be like:\n\nA gets previous submissions: None\nB gets previous submissions: None\nA submits all, since all are new\nB submits all, since it also thinks all are new\n\nThe reason is that a) getting previous submissions and b) submitting is not atomic/a single transaction, there's a delay (usually small, but can be big if a pipeline hangs/system overloaded etc.)\nAn easy way to fix this is to allow the pipeline to use a timestamp when it got the previous submissions, and submit that timestamp with the submission. The backend would then reject the submission if there has been a more recent submission, after the original timestamp.\nAll this would require is:\n\nfor the backend to set a timestamp \"timestamp_of_start_most_recent_submission\", and update it whenever the submit endpoint is hit\nthe backend would return this timestamp whenever ingest asks for previous submissions\ningest would submit that returned timestamp to the backend together with submissions\nthe backend would reject the submission if the timestamp values are not identical\n\nRight now, ingest assumes that this race condition never happens, so it ends up crashing once the race condition has happened. While we could try to work around it in ingest, the cleanest way is for the backend to implement the above transaction logic. Ingest can't undo submissions, so the best is for backend to offer transactions like this.\nWhile it might seem that this feature is only useful to the special submitter \"ingest\", as ingest uses the normal public API for submission, this feature would help anyone who programatically submits to Loculus and wants to ensure they don't publish duplicates.\nI label this a bug and an enhancement, because there is no way that a submitter can avoid this race condition with the current A",

Reingest checks the hash of each segment group by recalculating the submissionId of that group, which is comprised of the concatenated INSDC Ids of the grouped segments. If a new segment is added to the group the new submissionId will contain another INSDC Id and thus will not be found by reingest. This means that we will keep the old segment group and create a new segment group containing one more segment. The old segments will have two accessions in loculus. This should be easy to fix with a change to the compare_hashes.py script - as we get a list of all INSDC submissionIds associated with a sample when we query loculus.",

I think that it would be better to only count HAS_ERRORS+AWAITING_APPROVAL as \"awaiting review\" and count RECEIVED+IN_PROCESSING as \"in processing\".\n\nFor now, the current solution is fine in my opinion and I am happy for this PR to be merged because we expect the processing to be very fast for Pathoplexus. But for instances where the processing pipeline can be slow, it is important to distinguish and I think that we should create an issue if it is not implemented in this PR.\nOriginally posted by @chaoran-chen in #2204 (comment)",

If a new segment is added to the group the new submissionId will contain another INSDC Id and thus will not be found by reingest. This means that we will keep the old segment group and create a new segment group containing one more segment. The old segments will have two accessions in loculus.

For each sequence, Pathoplexus creates a new row in the \"sequences\" table. It generates a new sequence ID. The revision number of the sequences is 1.\nWhen a user revises data, they send sequence IDs and unpreprocessed data. For each revised sequence, Pathoplexus creates a new row in the \"sequences\" table. It does not change any existing rows and does not create new sequence IDs. The new rows have an incremented revision number. A sequence can only be revised if it has the SILO_READY status (see below).\nWhen a user revokes data, they send sequence IDs. For each revoked sequence, Pathoplexus creates a new row in the \"sequences\" table. The unpreprocessed data are empty. The \"revoked\" flag is set to true. The new rows have an incremented revision number. A sequence can only be revoked if it has the SILO_READY status (see below).\nExample:\nGiven the following events:\n\nSubmit [{data: d1}, {data: d2}] -> ids: 1, 2\nRevise [{id: 1, data: d3}]\nRevoke [{id: 1}]\n\nThe \"sequences\" table would look as follows:\n\n\n\nSequence ID\nRevision\nRevoked\nUnpreprocessed data\n\n\n\n\n1\n1\nfalse\nd1\n\n\n2\n1\nfalse\nd2\n\n\n1\n2\nfalse\nd3\n\n\n1\n3\ntrue\n\n\n\n\nThe preprocessing pipeline runs for every entry where unpreprocessed data is not empty and adds preprocessed data, warnings, and errors.\n\n\n\nSequence ID\nRevision\nRevoked\nUnpreprocessed data\nPreprocessed data\nWarnings\nErrors\n\n\n\n\n1\n1\nfalse\nd1\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n2\n1\nfalse\nd2\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n1\n2\nfalse\nd3\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n1\n3\ntrue\n\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n\nWhen we update our preprocessing pipeline (e.g., when new UShER or Nextclade",

    "body": "We had some useful recent discussions about the complexities of multi-sequence ingest. At the moment, my understanding is that if someone updates a particular segment, that segment will have a new release date and that will trigger it to go under a new loculus accession. That specific aspect will hopefully be fixable by #2171 .\nBut IMO there's a broader thing we should aim towards which is just that all versions of a particular segment should ideally always be under the same Loculus accession grouping. There may potentially be edge cases where this isn't possible but I still think it's a good thing to keep in mind and to monitor.",

Restarted containers require more CPU than running ones.\nWe should investigate what the major contributors to the runaway are. Possible mitigations:\n\nsimply make sure we don't exceed 30% CPU usage, limit preview deployments\nnotify if this locked state is detected (e.g. if CPU usage goes >80%), or if there are scheduling errors in events\nadd extra nodes\ngive production proper cpu request budgets so production is not affected by cpu starvation overall",

We should switch to treating missing fields as having null and not saving them in the table.

However, we do not want to increase the version of a sample if the only changes are due to our mapping.\nSuggestion\nHash ingested metadata earlier - preferably prior to any reformatting or mapping to Loculus metadata fields. This will initially cause a change of hashes and a version update (which we should probably revert), but afterwards we will not have to worry about fixing ingest metadata mappings, or using more insdc metadata fields.\nPotential side effects\nIf an insdc metadata field that we do not use in Loculus is updated this will still cause a version increase.",

Ideally, there would be one set of publications per organism, to scope it correctly. We can then add these publications to the projects that we submit to ENA - this is a very common pattern and something we should eventually do to take full advantage of the available cross-linking.\nIt's also something we can already import from Genbank: many sequences/projects have papers listed already, so we could surface them in sequence view.",

With the new config they expect the new metadata field that does not exist.\nThe backend needs to be prepared for this case. It's designed to validate that processed data can be imported by SILO. So it should also catch the case when the config changes:\n\nThe backend could process data it sends to LAPIS/SILO and add in null fields, or LAPIS/SILO prepro could do this apon data retrieval. Such a change would mean the backend would not need to store fields with null - this could be removed from prepro and save on storage cost.\nIt could throw an error that we handle in the SILO import job - indicating that /get-released-data needs to wait for reprocessing, this would require us to wait for the preprocessing pipeline updates (when we bump the version) to rollout.\n\nOriginally posted by @fengelniederhammer and @anna-parker in #2945 (comment)",

In particular, since we 'let everything in' we should allow users to then have useful ways to filter out things that may be questionable.\nThere are many ways we could run with this afterwards, but as a first step, we should bring these fields in.\nCurrent status:\nCurrently we have pulled in only QC fields that are 'objective' (e.g. counts of missing Nucs) and avoided those that are specific to Nextclade\nHowever these could be not-ideal for getting an overall feel for the quality of a sequence and having one good place to filter out 'bad stuff'\nPossible Objectives:\n\nPull in some of the 'less-objective' fields from Nextclade (ex: overall QC score)\n\nNeed a list of possible fields\n\n\nMake it clear(er) these are from Nextclade and how they're generated/what they mean\nMake it clear these fields may change over time (ex: a 'bad' seq may become 'good' if it's now recognised correctly as a recombinant rather than an outlier)",

Inspecting the db showed that 15 sequences weren't processed by v2, these also weren't in processing or anything.\nInspection of the audit logs showed that the 15 sequences that were not getting processed had been deleted by a user while they were not yet released.\nBecause we don't properly use foreign key constraints (we really should, see #3201) it's possible that sequence entries disappear but the processed data remains without the db complaining (the db would have made us notice this bug much earlier and probably more bugs like that).\nThe fix is probably to delete all processed rows associated with an unreleased deleted entry. There might well be edge cases that will remain tricky, and until we have foreign key constraints I won't trust us to be bug free there.\nWe haven't noticed this because we never tried to upgrade pipeline version after someone had deleted something - kind of hard to test using our current setup. That's why foreign key constraints would be so useful. @chaoran-chen likely thought there were such constraints in place, at least in terms of the outcome of deletions - hence the case of entries are deleted, processed data is still there wasn't considered.",

    "body": "This ticket is about which features we would like to have for revised and revoked sequences from the data user's perspective as well as how to model it in SILO. I'm putting both together because they are largely coupled, especially since the way we model it in SILO directly determines the user experience for API users.\n(Background: The implementation of revision/revocation in the backend is described here: https://github.com/pathoplexus/pathoplexus/blob/3abbd9f7168feaad110c0fb99a59290788eede7f/backend/docs/runtime_view.md#revision)\nHere's my proposal:\nFeatures:\n\nOn the details page of a sequence, if there is a newer version of the sequence, the user should see a note saying that there is a newer version and linking to the newest version.\nOn the details page of a sequence, if there is a newer version of the sequence and the newest version is a \"revocation entry\", the user should see a note saying that the sequence was revoked and linking to the newest version.\nOn the details page of a sequence, if it is a \"revocation entry\", the page should show the revocation date.\nNot sure: What do we show on the details page of a sequence, if there is a newer version of the sequence that is a \"revocation entry\" but the newest version is not a \"revocation entry\"? I.e., if the sequence was revoked and then unrevoked? Proposal: This is a very rare case and for simplicity, we don't add special handling and let it be covered by (1): i.e., we just link to the newest version but don't mention revocation.\nThe search only queries the latest versions and non-revoked data.\nThrough the API/bulk download, people can get all revisions and revocation entries. People should be able to see when a sequence was revised and revoked (and unrevoked).\n\nIn SILO, we have the following special columns:\n\n\nsequenceIdWithVersion - the primary key\n\n\nsequenceId\n\n\nversion\n\n\nisRevocation - indicates that this is a revocation entry. The entry doesn't contain any sequence and sequence-related metadata. It does cont",

One can also argue it should just redirect to the latest version.)\n/seq/[sequence_id].version (shows specific version)\n/seq/[sequence_id].fa or /seq/[sequence_id].[version].fa provide Fasta output.

    "body": "This is to discuss how we can support multiple pathogens on the backend side. Originally (at the very beginning of the project), I thought that we might want to launch one instance of the backend per pathogen (just as we do with SILO/LAPIS). Now, considering the architecture of our backend, I think that this doesn't make sense and that it would be easy to add multi-pathogen support.\nURLs\nI assume that there won't really be a need to request or submit data of different pathogens in one request. For example, we don't expect/won't want to allow users to make submissions that contain sequence entries of different pathogens. Also, each preprocessing pipeline will probably be dedicated to only one pathogen. Thus, I suggest having the pathogen name as a path parameter:\n/{pathogen}/submit\n/{pathogen}/extract-unprocessed-data\n...\n\nConfig\nI am not sure how to best design a configuration system and organize configuration files. Just one thought inspired by Nginx/LaTeX/...: In Nginx, there is one (root) config file - (usually) nginx.conf (see example file), and it can include individual files or whole directories. There are common structures such as having one config file per site but in principle, everything can also be written in a single config file. Is that maybe a good approach for us going forward?\nDatabase\nInternally, we only need to add a column pathogen to the sequences table.\nWhat's the primary key then? See below.\nAccession\nOption 1: Sequence entries across pathogens within an instance share the same accession space.\nOption 2: Sequence entries of different pathogens have separate accession spaces. They could have different prefixes.\nIn favor of option 1:\n\nA prefix stands for the instance and helps people to recognize an instance.\nIt avoids having a lot of different prefixes.\nIt is what INSDC do.\n\nIn favor of option 2:\n\nPeople can recognize the pathogen from the prefix.\nNot sure if this is relevant.. It would make it easier to merge instances that hold different patho",

    "body": "Pathoplexus will be two things:\n\nan instance of Loculus, providing a database\na social/political project which needs: pages about governance, documentation, policies, funding, etc.\n\nThe latter are not part of loculus, but will be housed on a shared website. We need some way of allowing this. I previously raised this in https://github.com/orgs/loculus-project/discussions/112 but I think it's reaching the point of being worth an Issue.\nMy own view is that we really want to allow ourselves quite a bit of flexibility in the Pathoplexus-specific pages. I would like the option to e.g. embed a Twitter widget for example, and to have photos of the Governance people. And I'd really like to keep open the possibility of arbitrary HTML, to e.g. have a Nextstrain build or something.\nI've come to the conclusion that the best way to do this is to have the pathoplexus website have its own Docker image. We would have a repo which would contain a website directory which would simply be copied on top of the loculus website directory and then be built as an image. This directory would contain only the pathoplexus-specific pages (and potentially subpages used as includes).\nI'm happy to implement this in Feb - just wanted to capture the issue while we're in the mode of capturing Issues. Open to discussion if people don't like this way of going about it, but I do think it has the fewest drawbacks.",

    "body": "Sometimes, we would like to update and rerun the pre-processing pipeline (due to new clade designations, improvements, adding new fields, etc.). Here's a proposal for the implementation:\n\nThe backend has a current_preprocessing_version and a staging_preprocessing_version.\nThe administrator can start reprocessing by setting a new staging_preprocessing_version.\nWe add the following columns to the sequence_entries table:\n\npreprocessing_pipeline_version - Stores the pipeline version of processed_data\nstaging_processed_data, staging_errors, stating_warnings, staging_preprocessing_pipeline_version\n\n\nWhen calling the /extract-unprocessed-data endpoint, the preprocessing pipeline has to state its version. The endpoint also returns data if the version is the staging_preprocessing_version and the sequence has not been reprocessed.\nWhen a preprocessing pipeline submits preprocessed data through /submit-processed-data, it must also state its version. Based on the version, the data is stored either in the \"production\" fields or in the staging fields.\nIf a new preprocessing pipeline reports an error for a sequence that has already been released, the administrator (and the curators?) gets a notification. It is not possible/safe to release the reprocessed data until the issue has been resolved.\nOnce the new preprocessing pipeline has caught up and all sequences in the Awaiting_approval or Approved_for_release state are processed by the new version, the content in the staging fields gets swapped in.\n\nWhat do you think about this approach? Do you think that we need to implement it before the MVP launch or can it be added afterwards? (I'm in favor of adding it afterwards.)",

    "body": "A public loculus instance that sends data to INSDC must be able to authenticate users somehow - we cannot allow anonymous submissions. Otherwise anyone on the internet can submit sequences to INSDC and upload garbage.\nIn discussion with @bh-ethz  and @chaoran-chen  we discussed two options:\na) Email allowlist: certain domains allow us to identify users, e.g. university email addresses. If someone signs up with such an email address and they confirm ownership of the email address this should be sufficient trust to allow them to submit.\nb) For users who do not have an email address on the allowlist, admins can give manual approval\nGiven the current setup, where we give accessions as soon as a submitter starts the submission, we should not allow even that step for anonymous accounts, as we can otherwise run out of accessions. This could be softened if we had a way to rate limit anonymous accounts, e.g. allow submission of at most 100-1000 sequences without being approved for submission (via allowlist or manually).\nA rate limit is probably not a bad idea in general, even for users who are allowlisted. Depending on a pathogen, there's a clear max size of submission that should be very unlikely to ever be exceed. E.g. it's unlikely anyone will ever submit more than 10k mpox sequences, given there are only 7.5k sequences on Genbank. The issue with a rate limit is that it does require quite some extra backend work, whereas an allowlist should be straightforward.",

The admin can/should (of course) limit the maximum size.\nSome thoughts:\n\nDo we want to be able to resume after a short connection disruption? Maybe we can use tus.io or resumable.js Not relevant for MVP.\nWhat are the compression formats that we should support? zip, zstd, gz, and xz?\nShould the user also be able to upload large uncompressed files? If they do, maybe we can compress them in the browser/CLI software first? Or do we (for now) simply reject large uncompressed files (e.g., above 1 GB)?\nWe need to have protection again zip bombs.\nThe implementation needs to be memory-efficient (we shouldn't hold multiple GBs of data in RAM for one upload).",

When I included this is in a PR before @fengelniederhammer sensibly pointed out it would break the ability to run the e2e tests in codespaces - but I'm the only person using the codespaces atm as far as I know and I personally only run these tests from CI.\nI have tried running ./deploy.py helm uninstall and then redeploying with processing enabled after startup, but this yields an error message about the groups table already existing or something. In general I think the ability to get data into the DB is more important than the ability to run the E2E tests from the codespace so I think this makes sense as the lesser of two evils.

Also adds a new view transitions option transition:persist-props (default: false) to prevent props from updating as needed.\nIslands which have the transition:persist property to keep their state when using the <ViewTransitions /> router will now have their props updated upon navigation. This is useful in cases where the component relies on page-specific props, such as the current page title, which should update upon navigation.\nFor example, the component below is set to persist across navigation. This component receives a products props and might have some internal state, such as which filters are applied:\n<ProductListing transition:persist products={products} />\nUpon navigation, this component persists, but the desired pr",

In this example, a counter's state is preserved and moved to the new page:\n<Counter count={5} client:load transition:persist />\nSee our View Transitions Guide to learn more on usage.\n\n\nPatch Changes\n\n\n#7821 c00b6f0c4 Thanks @\u200bottomated! - Fixes an issue that prevents importing 'astro/app'\n\n\n#7917 1f0ee494a Thanks @\u200bbluwy! - Prevent integration hooks from re-triggering if the server restarts on config change, but the config fails to load.\n\n\n#7901 00cb28f49 Thanks @\u200bbluwy! - Improve sourcemap generation and performance\n\n\n#7911 c264be349 Thanks @\u200bmartrapp! - fix for #7882 by setting state in page navigation (view transitions)\n\n\n\n\n...

In this example, a counter's state is preserved and moved to the new page:\n<Counter count={5} client:load transition:persist />\n\n\n\n\n... (truncated)\n\n\nChangelog\nSou",

I had to port it from styled-components to tailwind.\nBadge segments are colored dynamically, depending on a character or gene name. I use style attr to handle that.\nAdditionally, the text is being rendered of light or dark color depending on the contrast ratio relative to background color. I had to add polished NPM package to calculate contrast ratio.\nNotes:\n\n\nThere is no fixed list of genes/CDSes avaialble, so it's not immediately possible to render stable (recognizable) gene/CDS colors, which may increase readablity of aa badges significantly. In Nextclade the list is provided from \"backend\" and then gene index in the list is used to select color from a fixed list of colors (with index wrap on overflow), and in Covariants the list is static, as it only deals with SC2. In both cases, color palette is taken from nextstrain.org \"Nucleotide diversity of genome\" panel, as something we are the most accustomed to in Nextstrain organization. In Loclulus I decided to use color hash algorithm to generate colors from gene name strings for now. If backend could provide this data, then UX could be further improved.\n\n\nIt seems that DataTable.astro is only able to render values that are strings or numbers. I don't immediately see how the badges can be incorporated there without hacks. I need a bit more details of what's planned for this component. So for now I just temporarily added some hardcoded badges above the table as a showcase.\n\n\nFrom a quick look, I found that backend currently provides mutations in string format, e.g. A123G. This means that these strings need to be parsed in order to extract gene, position, and ref and query characters. In Covariants this is done using regex like that. It's a bit of a hairy adventure though. So if backend could precompute and",

The log file location is hardcoded in this case.\n\n\nfor the client: an POST-endpoint is created where client-logs can be send to. These logs will be appended to the local file\n\n\ndeploying via docker locally works as expected. (docker build -t website . && DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME=website docker-compose up)\n\nDeployment on netlify breaks since they deploy serverless functions and the simple approach (plain old log-files) cannot work.\nI left the hardcoded log folder as is, but this breaks the admin endpoint on netlify.\n\n\n\nhttps://develop.sentry.dev/self-hosted/ would be an alternative, but is another service that has to be deployed and maintained.

This used to be a string, but is now an object.\nIf you are relying on config.title (for example in a custom <SiteTitle> or <Head> component), you will need to update your code. We recommend using the new siteTitle prop available to component overrides:\n---\nimport type { Props } from '@astrojs/starlight/props';\n// The site title for this page\u2019s language:\nconst { siteTitle } = Astro.props;\n\n\n#1613 61493e55 Thanks @\u200bHiDeoo! - Adds new draft frontmatter option to exclude a page from production builds.\n\n\n#640 7dc503ea Thanks @\u200bHiDeoo! - Updates the default line-height from 1.8 to 1.75. This change avoids having a line height with a fractional part which can cause scripts accessing dimensions involving the line height to get an inconsistent rounded value in various browsers.\nIf you want to preserve the previous line-height, you can add the following custom CSS to your site:\n:root {\n\t--sl-line-height: 1.8;\n}\n\n\n#1720 749ddf85 Thanks @\u200bjacobdalamb! - Updates astro-expressive-code dependency to the latest minor release (0.35) and exposes a new @astrojs/starlight/expressive-code/hast module for users who need to use Expressive Code\u2019s version of hast.\nThis includes a potentially breaking change if you use custom Expressive Code plugins.

Babel and esbuild transformations are removed, which should result in faster build times. The refactor requires using Astro v4.8.0 but no other changes are necessary.\n\n\n#10935 ddd8e49 Thanks @\u200bbluwy! - Allows integrations after the MDX integration to update markdown.remarkPlugins and markdown.rehypePlugins, and have the plugins work in MDX too.\nIf your integration relies on Astro's previous behavior that prevents integrations from adding remark/rehype plugins for MDX, you will now need to configure @astrojs/mdx with extendMarkdownConfig: false and explicitly specify any remarkPlugins and rehypePlugins options instead.\n\n\n#10935 ddd8e49 Thanks @\u200bbluwy! - Renames the optimize.customComponentNames option to optimize.ignoreElementNames to better reflect its usecase. Its behaviour is not changed and should continue to work as before.\n\n\n#10935 ddd8e49 Thanks @\u200bbluwy! - Replaces the internal remark-images-to-component plugin with rehype-images-to-component to let users use additional rehype plugins for images\n\n\nPatch Changes\n\n\n#10935 ddd8e49 Thanks @\u200bbluwy! - Simplifies plain MDX components as hast element nodes to further improve HTML string inlining for the optimize option\n\n\n#10935 ddd8e49 Thanks @\u200bbluwy! - Allows Vite plugins to transform .mdx files before the MDX plugin transforms it\n\n\n#10935 ddd8e49 Thanks @\u200bbluwy! - Updates the optimize option to group static sibling nodes as a <Fragment />. This reduces the number of AST nodes and simplifies runtime rendering of MDX pages.\n\n\n#10935 ddd8e49 Thanks @\u200bbluwy! - Tags the MDX component export for quicker component checks while rendering\n\n\n#10935 ddd8e49 Thanks @\u200bbluwy! - Fixes export const components keys detection for the optimize option\n\n\n#10935 ddd8e49 Thanks @\u200bbluwy! - Improves optimize ",

Adding the segmented option means that the metadata item is different for each segment. Thus, the config files will create #(segments) metadata items, each with the segment name concatenated to the end of the name, i.e. name_segment.\n\n\nUpdate preprocessing pipelines: take multi segmented input.\n\n\n\nresolves #1915\n\npreview URL: https://ccfv.loculus.org/cchf/search\nScreenshot\n\n\nPR Checklist\n\n\n Get the nextclade_datasets to work with docker -> nextstrain/nextclade_data#199\n Modify ingest pipeline further: properly hash for multiple segments, join segments based on isolate and join metadata correctly.\n Make sure that all config files are correctly generated, fix some small bugs: get segments from config directly, make sure that displayNames are correctly modified\n Fix reingest bug\n Fix website sequence tab box bug\n Refactor ingest to only merge groups after processing metadata\n Fix preprocessing config file: instead of adding segmented field generate dictionary with renamed fields (like in other configs)\n Upload ref sequences to corneliusroemer/seqs to avoid values.yaml getting too large\n All necessary documentation has been adapted.\n The implemented feature is covered by an appropriate test. -> moved to a later PR",

Inheritance is currently done via yaml anchor, aliases and merge keys\nMake values.yaml more compact by generating the previously separate a) ingest, b) preprocessing and c) inputFields configs from schema.metadata.\nUse default values in values.yaml to make it more compact, e.g. string is the default type, so one less line for most metadata fields to define.\nIntroduce \"header: Other\" as the default header so as not to show fields under no header\n\nWithout the compactification, we'd be looking at multiple thousands of lines of yaml, which is not nice to work with (already now VS code and vim complain about the size)",

You can disable optimization by adding MDX manually to your integrations array in astro.config.mjs:\nimport { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';\n+ import mdx from '@astrojs/mdx';\nimport starlight from '@astrojs/starlight';\n// https://astro.build/config\nexport default defineConfig({\nintegrations: [\nstarlight({\ntitle: 'My docs',\n// ...\n}),\n\n\n  mdx(),\n\n],\n});\n\n\n\n#1735 1a9ab50d Thanks @\u200bHi",

In order to do this the per_segment parameter must also be added as a field to the preprocessing arguments. For example:\n\n- name: total_unknown_nucs\n        type: int\n        header: \"Alignment states and QC metrics\"\n        noInput: true\n        rangeSearch: true\n        per_segment: true\n        preprocessing:\n          args: { type: int, per_segment: true }\n          inputs: { input: nextclade.totalMissing }\n\n\nI then adjusted the prepro code to use this argument when updating the metadata fields.\nThis PR also cleans up the prepro file a bit by moving some functions to another script as prepro is getting a bit too large.\n\n\nScreenshot",

It requires the organism, the name of the external submitter e.g. ENA and a ndjson object which includes the external metadata. The following rules apply:\n\n\nGiven sequence entries must exist (identified by the column 'accession' in the metadata file)\nThe user is authorized to use this endpoint, i.e. user is a member of external_metadata_updater role\nThe last accession version is in status  'APPROVED_FOR_RELEASE', i.e. can be released externally\nexternal metadata meets validation requirements: correct type, missing/required fields are correct - this is defined in the config (only external metadata that has the field externalSubmitter equal to the externalSubmitter set in the call will be checked).\nIf any of above is not fulfilled, this will return an error and roll back the whole transaction.\n\n\nUpdates the backend_config template to add an external_metadata field to the backend config. This field is the same as the metadata field except that it contains an additional field externalMetadataUpdater. This is currently set to ena by default however the backend uses this value when verifying the external metadata.\n\nPR Checklist\n\n\n All necessary documentation has been adapted.\n The implemented feature is covered by an appropriate test.\n Figure out why tests run ok on their own but fail when run using ./gradlew test.\n Modify backend config to have a separate metadata field for external metadata\n Make sure authorization for e",

After a lot of experimenting and discussing with @fengelniederhammer and @JonasKellerer last week it appears best to use the ktlint CLI and apply stricter formatting to avoid further confusion.\nThis is the result of using ktlint --editorconfig=.editorconfig --format to format the backend. As a side note this is very similar to the default intellij IDE formatting when I apply Reformat Code to the entire folder (that also applies changes to all files in the same way except at 3 single locations - I assume there is some difference in the intellij defaults vs the ktlint defaults).",

This pod has the authorization of external_metadata_updater.\nAt pod initialization:\n\nFlyway migrate will run and if not already existing it will create a new schema ena-submission inside the loculus database.  This schema will include 4 tables: 1 with general state of submission to ENA, and then one for each stage of the submission process: project, sample and assembly creation.\nFlyway runs in its own docker container. This allows us to keep the sql table version files in a folder inside the ena-submission folder.\n\nAfter initialization is complete the pod runs\n\nsnakemake get_ena_submission_list: For the moment this just calls the get-released-data endpoint for data in state APPROVED_FOR_RELEASE. The data is then filtered:\n\ndata must be state \"OPEN\" for use\ndata must not already exist in ENA or be in the submission process.To prevent this we need to make sure:\n\ndata was not submitted by the config.ingest_pipeline_submitter\ndata is not in submission_table\nas an extra check we discard all sequences with ena-specific-metadata fields (if users uploaded correctly this should not be needed)\n\n\n\n\nIdeally the sequences in ena_submission_list.json would then be manually approved and written to a new file ena_submission_approved.json and we would continue with the upload to ENA.\n\nThis PR also contains the rule submit_external_metadata:\n\nFunction to submit external metadata to the backend (using #2146) once submission is complete.\n\nScreenshot\n\nPR Checklist\n\n\n All necessary documentation has been adapted.\n Use flyway and make sure pods can start\n Kubernetes configs: have one ena-submission-pod with configs for all organisms\n Use external_metadata parameters for get_ena_submission_list.

Reference sequences are only added to loculus after ingestion from NCBI - meaning we will not be able to know the accession in advance unless we change how this is handled by the database.\nThe easiest solution to let users know which reference is used for alignment and mutations is to add the INSDC accession to the values.yaml and add a link to that reference on the view page. We can later make this more fancy and query loculus to find out which accession in loculus this corresponds to and replace the link.\nScreenshot",

The problem with this is that the backend will reject requests including a sequence without required fields (if they are not in an error state) - which means all other sequences in that request will also be rejected - so we are currently missing a lot of sequences on main.\nThis PR adds back the required field to the prepro configs and it modifies prepro to put sequences without required fields in an error state.\nScreenshot\nInstead of merging this PR we could also remove the required flag from  sample_collection_date. Making sample_collection_date required has the largest effect on the number of sequences in loculus, this was pre making it required - I found a preview from before I merged the last PR: https://isodates.loculus.org/ But if we nolonger make sample_collection_date required we then we need to update the metadata docs:",

This release page lists all changes made to the project during the beta. For the migration guide, please refer to the documentation.\n\ud83d\udea8 Breaking Changes\n\nSimplify mock function generic types and align with jest - by @\u200bhi-ogawa in vitest-dev/vitest#4784 (a0c1d37)\nRemove --segfault-retry - by @\u200bsheremet-va in vitest-dev/vitest#5514 (ed60e)\n\nThis flag was introduced to combat threads segfaults. Our current recommendation is to use the new default forks pool instead.\n\n\nRun suite hooks in a stack - by @\u200bsheremet-va in vitest-dev/vitest#5609 (1277d)\n\nThis feels like a more sensible default. Especially with the new onTestFinished hook. This can make your tests run a little bit slower.\n\n\nEnable coverage.ignoreEmptyLines by default - by @\u200bAriPerkkio in vitest-dev/vitest#5543 (31994)\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f This change may cause significant differences in your coverage results compared to Vitest v1. These changes are expected as coverage reporting is now more accurate. See vitest-dev/vitest#5423 for more details.\n\n\nAdd correct location and snapshot fields in json reporter - by @\u200bsheremet-va in vitest-dev/vitest#5434 (bcccc)\n\nPreviously, the location field pointed to the error location instead of the test location. Now it is aligned with jest and contains the line and column of a test function, but requires includeTaskLocation to be enabled.\n\n\nUpdate dependency chai to v5 - by renovate[bot] and @\u200bsheremet-va in vitest-dev/vitest#5135 (73646)\nRemove watchExclude - by @\u200bpatak-dev in vitest-dev/vitest#5177 (d7371)\nChange default pool t",

This can also theoretically work with subdomains, with backend.pathoplexus.loculus.org. However we were running out of certificates with all our preview instances so we created a wildcard certificate for *.loculus.org. You cannot create a wildcard certificate with two wildcards (*.*.loculus.org) and so we have adopted a strategy where we instead use a pattern like authentication-pathoplexus.loculus.org for preview instances. However for the main pathoplexus instance we want to revert to authentication.pathoplexus.org so this PR adds a configurable value subdomainSeparator that can be set to - or . as we wish.",

None of the logs showed any of this. By looking at the code, I figured that I probably run into the first error case. Actually it's a configuration issue and not a user issue, so I would expect that I see this somewhere in some logs.\nAlso I was hoping that the function could concatenate arbitrary values, but instead it concatenates values with the accession version. It would be great if this was a little more general and preprocessing functions could pick from user-supplied metadata and from loculus-internal metadata arbitrarily. Are you planning to integrate this? We would like to remap the loculus-internal metadata at some point, there it would be nice to have it for all functions.\nPlease check whether this is valid Python syntax. There don't seem to be any unit tests that would make it easy to test it locally.\nScreenshot\n\nPR Checklist\n\n\n[ ] All necessary documentation has been adapted.\n[ ] The implemented feature is covered by an appropriate test.

Elements (or their children) may be removed from the DOM during the parse,\nfor e.g. to conserve memory, providing a mechanism to parse an input document that would otherwise be too large to fit\ninto memory, yet still providing a DOM interface to the document and its elements. Additionally, the parser provides\na selectFirst(String query) / selectNext(String query), which will run the parser until a hit is found, at which\npoint the parse is suspended. It can be resumed via another select() call, or via the stream() or iterator()\nmethods. 2096\nDownload Progress: added a Response Progress event interface, which reports progress and URLs are downloaded (and\nparsed).

This can lead to confusion. This also means that all organisms currently must have the same fields as perSegment.\nUsing the values.yaml as the source of truth for perSegment will make it easier to have different fields specified as perSegment for different organisms.\nAdditionally, we have a dummy config.yaml in the ingest pipeline which can be used when testing ingest but should actually be replaced by the output of the generate_local_configs script.\nSummary\n\nDo not hardcode segment_specific_fields for all organisms, but create this from the values.yaml, allowing different organisms to have different conditions.\nRemove the dummy config.yaml and fields that should come from the config from defaults\nFound error in configs: sra_run_accession and ncbi_protein_count need to be perSegment, but biosample and bioproject accession should be per sample/group => after discussion below we remove ncbi_protein_count entirely as unused and confusing.\nAs perSegment hash is used only by ingest internally add it in the ingest code.\n\nScreenshot\n\nPR Checklist\n\n\n Works locally\n Has no change in number of sequences ingested on main -> there is a duplication again but I think this is just the cronjob bug",

Currently we would add new groups and keep old groups, potentially having ingested sequences twice with no warning for users that the metadata has been updated.\nThis PR adds code that will detect this edge case (grouping change) and provides code to add the new groups and revoke the old ones. As there is a potential risk of over-revocation we should only run the revoke rule under manual oversight so although the code is added here I have not added the revoke rule to the rule all . In a later PR: #2392 I will add code to send us an automated message if such a change is detected and then we can launch a job which runs this snakemake rule.\nThis PR also adds very basic unit tests to ensure that revise and revoke work as expected.\nScreenshot\n\nRan locally with test data (altering metadata to break grouping and cause revision)\n\nRevocation is successful:\n and new sequences are added.\nRevision is successful and version is updated:\n\n\nPR Checklist\n\n\n When run locally with engineered data (see data in test folder) this will revise and revoke sequences as desired.\n The implemented feature is covered by an appropriate test.",

If your application opens many connections in a short period and doesn\u2019t properly close them, you might run out of available local ports.\" - it might be possible to fix this just with better closing of port connections... I checked and the postgresDB can support SHOW max_connections; = 100. After the ena-submission-pod jobs were killed there were still SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity; = 20 connections to the db. Probably from the backend. I wasn't closing db updates (this would explain ~20-30 additional connections).\n\n\nIt also fixes an issue in the backend when merging external metadata with other metadata fields, an alternative solution could be:\n\n\ncreate or replace function jsonb_concat(a jsonb, b jsonb) \nreturns jsonb\nlanguage plpgsql\nimmutable\nparallel safe\nas $$\ndeclare\n    result jsonb;\nbegin\n    -- Merge the two JSON objects\n    result := a || jsonb_object_agg(key, \n                case \n                    when a->key is null or a->key = 'null' then b->key \n                    else a->key \n                end)\n                from jsonb_each_text(b) as elem(key, value);\n    return result;\nend;\n$$;\nand use this like:\ncase \n       when all_external_metadata.external_metadata is null then jsonb_build_object('metadata', (sequence_entries_preprocessed_data.processed_data->'metadata'))\n        else jsonb_build_object('metadata', (sequence_entries_preprocessed_data.processed_data->'metadata') || all_external_metadata.external_metadata)\n    end as joint_metadata\nScreenshot\n\nPR Checklist\n\n\n Confirm this works locally from uploading new sequences, getting the sequen",

    "body": "I just spent a loooong time debugging a confusing issue on Pathoplexus. It manifested as the database sealed secret that couldn't be extracted as it appeared to be corrupt. It was very confusing because I could see the sealed secrets I had configured in values yaml and they hadn't changed. It turned out that what had happened was that we added a new key host to the database secret in the default values.yaml recently. That default values yaml doesn't use sealed secrets at all, it defines them in a raw format. But because that value hadn't been added to pathoplexus's values.yaml in any form, and because pathoplexus values.yaml redefines the database secret as a sealed secret, what ended up happening was that the sealed secrets controller attempted to extract the host key, merged in from the default values yaml, even though that had never been sealed. This was so confusing to debug that I want to avoid it ever happening again, so now we will store sealed secrets under encryptedData not data so that you cannot get merging of a sealed and unsealed secret.\nhttps://different-key-sealed-secr.loculus.org/",

This moves it to the top of the Node adapter.\n\n\n\n\n\nCommits\n\n6bb0014 [ci] release (#11686)\n315ec07 fix(deps): update all non-major dependencies (#11674)\nf5616a8 [ci] format\n932bd2e Encrypt server islands props (#11535)\n72c7ae9 update formatter config (#11640)\nea82b03 Improve regex performance (#11635)\n750d532 fix(deps): update all non-major dependencies (#11565)\nSee full diff in compare view\n\n\n\nUpdates astro from 4.13.3 to 4.14.2\n\nRelease notes\nSourced from astro's releases.\n\nastro@4.14.2\nPatch Changes\n\n#11733 391324d Thanks @\u200bbluwy! - Reverts back to yargs-parser package for CLI argument parsing\n\nastro@4.14.1\nPatch Changes\n\n\n#11725 6c1560f Thanks @\u200bascorbic! - Prevents content layer importing nod",

For elements that are in the same stacking context, we are able to use z-index to put something on top but this does not work across contexts. And by default, due to the order of the elements, the header was below the main content on the z-axis and, therefore, elements within the main content, if they have a different context, will remain on top.

    "body": "Bumps jsdom from 24.1.1 to 25.0.0.\n\nRelease notes\nSourced from jsdom's releases.\n\nVersion 25.0.0\nThis major release changes the prototype of a jsdom's EventTarget.prototype to point to the Object.prototype inside the jsdom, instead of pointing to the Node.js Object.prototype.

In order to do this I add the option for the mocked prepro pipeline to process restricted data. Disclaimer: With our current e2e set up we cannot test this entire process. So I am actually just testing that if the prepro pipeline sends us restricted data we keep it restricted. The user sets a sequence to state restricted before we send it to the prepro pipeline and the e2e tests mock the entire interaction with the prepro pipeline. So in theory the prepro pipeline could just remove the restricted label and send us back open data and this test would not detect it.\nFix error that was flagged when running tests locally: Warning: Each child in a list should have a unique \"key\" prop\" is a valid error by adding a key to a map function.\nThe e2e tests do not actually include the preprocessing pipeline, I will create a new issue to address this.\n\nScreenshot\n\nPR Checklist\n\n\n Check if it is actually necessary to add a separate group for restricted data.\n Update docs",

    "body": "partially resolves #2724\n\npreview URL: http://add-count-in-header.loculus.org/\nSummary\nAs we send data in ndjson format, clients (such as the silo_import_job) have no way of knowing if the data they have received is complete or if the stream was interrupted early.\nTo fix this, /get-released-data adds header x-rowcount to the response with the total number of expected records in the accompanying stream.\nClients can then compare this number with the responseBody to see if they have received all records and discard/re-request in case the stream was aborted early.\nSmall caveat\n\nThe actual streaming is executed after getReleased is defined. This means the count calculated for the header and the results of the stream are not inside the same database transaction. This means that if the table was updated in between calculating the record and streaming there could be more records in the stream than expected from the header.\nsilo_import_job will not use the data received from get-released-data if x-total-records header and the actual record count do not match. Meaning it could take slightly longer for new sequences to appear in the database but this should be negligible.\nThis only causes a problem if the stream is cut off after exactly as many records as expected from the header. (e.g. count is 20, add one new sequence, stream should include 21 records, stream is cut off after record 20, client thinks stream completed successfully - but we lost an arbitrary sequence).\nPR Checklist\n\n\n All necessary documentation has been adapted.\n The implemented feature is covered by an appropriate test.\n Add zstd (and probably jq to the silo-preprocessing docker image) - jq is already there: GenSpectrum/LAPIS-SILO#574, update: I can install zstd after the container is set up, not very clean but this works\n Break stream locally and check that this still works as intended.\nTest locally by adding a Thread.sleep(1000) between stream iterations in streamAsNdjson and killing the backend mid-stream",

It blocks E2E tests and ena-submission-image builds (this in turn should block update-argocd-metadata.yml)\n\nJust confirmed, argocd can start but ena-submission pod will not as they are unable to pull the new image (as this has not been created)\n\ncontainer \"ena-submission\" in pod \"loculus-ena-submission-5485589f45-t85fm\" is waiting to start: trying and failing to pull image\nHowever, if the preview is already running and then the flag is changed to submitToEnaProduction: true the reloader will push the changes to the ena-submission pod, to prevent this add an additional list of allowed_submission_hosts in the defaults. Only hosts in this list will be able to talk to ena production (even if the submitToEnaProduction flag is set to true)\nPR Checklist\n\n\n All necessary documentation has been adapted.\n The implemented feature is covered by an appropriate test.",

We should stop other rules if one fails.\nSummary\n\n\nCreate a new package called ena_deposition. One config is generated at startup, this uses defaults from the config/default.yaml and then overwrites additional config arguments from the passed config/config.yaml (as the snakefile did before). This reduces repetition as instead of one config for each rule, also there is now only one config and only one cli entry point.\nThe create_project,create_sample, create_assembly, trigger_submission and upload_external_metadata functions are run in parallel threads (instead of before being run in parallel snakemake rules) and use stop_event to stop all threads if one fails.\nTested that this works as intended on a preview by causing an Exception to be raised in the trigger_submission function thread - this lead to all other threads being stopped and the pod stopping and being restarted by kubernetes:\n\n13:33:20    DEBUG (  create_assembly.py: 455) - Checking state in ENA\nTask generated an exception: Testing threads stop!!!\nupload_external_metadata stopped due to exception in another task\ncreate_sample stopped due to exception in another task\ncreate_assembly stopped due to exception in another task\ncreate_project stopped due to exception in another task\n\nAdditional changes:\n\nsnakemake was removed as a dependency, this lead to xmltodict working differently than before. I needed to create a new class called XmlNone for the case when a field is intentionally left None in the dictionary, e.g. SEQUENCING_PROJECT in the xml below:\n\n<SUBMISSION_PROJECT>\n    <SEQUENCING_PROJECT/>\n    <ORGANISM>\n        <TAXON_ID>Test taxon</TAXON_ID>\n        <SCIENTIFIC_NAME>Test scientific name</SCIENTIFIC_NAME>\n    </ORGANISM>\n</SUBMISSION_PROJECT>\n\nAs I now specify the log level in main I do not create a custom logger object for each script but use ",

If we also make a PR on deployments (with appropriate label being set) then one could test on staging with only labels and a single PR merge.\nIn the future, would be nice if the PRs were also auto-closed upon closing here (or removal of label), but let's see whether this feature is used or not before we sink more time into making it nicer to use.\n\nProbably requires pathoplexus/pathoplexus#226 to be merged to main first\nWorks: pathoplexus/pathoplexus#233",

This is of the format: country: division, where division can normally be further split into geoLocAdmin1 and geoLocAdmin2.\nSadly the format of the division field is inconsistent. For example for the US some samples have state, city others city, state, yet others do not separate state with a , but   or use the abbreviation. This means to extract more specific details we will need to do string matching. It also became clear to me that NIH does not clean their sequences based on the common occurrence of Conneticut. Astrahan is another example of this. I have now added a list of common misspellings, potentially in future we could use fuzzy matching for this.\nI got chatgpt to write me up some nice yaml lists with all states/regions/provinces for countries where we have a lot of samples with geoLocAdmin1 information.\nBy default for unmapped countries I keep the mapping as is: division is mapped to geoLocAdmin1.\nFor mapped countries I put the state(region/province) in geoLocAdmin1 if the division matches the state (division must include the state name). I put the entire division string into geoLocAdmin2 as well - unless it is an exact match for the state, then I do not additionally add it to geoLocAdmin2 (to avoid duplication). If no state matches division I put the entire division string in geoLocAdmin2.\nPotential Alternatives\n\naugur curate: https://docs.nextstrain.org/projects/augur/en/stable/usage/cli/curate/apply-geolocation-rules.html, this appears to rely on having a division and location field, this can be generated with https://docs.nextstrain.org/projects/augur/en/stable/usage/cli/curate/parse-genbank-location.html - remains to see how well this will work when division is not in a standard format\nhttps://pypi.org/project/pycountry/ has all countries and region based on ISO standards, also has fuzzy matching - will ",

It includes their official names, country codes and subdivision level. Fuzzywuzzy is another popular python library which matches strings using the Levenshtein distance (an edit distance algorithm), it can be modified to weight string matches higher when individual words in the string match.\nTakes INSDC geolocation string in format country: division\nReturns country and attempts to split division into geoLocAdmin1 and geoLocAdmin2.\n\nUse pycountry for official list of geoLocAdmin1 options and abbreviations\nAttempt exact match of division substring (split by \",\") to geoLocAdmin1\nAttempt exact match of division substring (split by \"\\s\" or \",\") to geoLocAdmin1 abbr\nAttempt fuzzy match of division substring (after removing common administrative_divisions substrings) to geoLocAdmin1\nIf no match, return division as geoLocAdmin2\n\nTests\n\nCan use comparison script in https://github.com/loculus-project/loculus/blob/show_geoloc_diffs/ingest/scripts/comparison.py to compare against main and augur curate\nHere you can see sorted tsv of what changes the two options will make:\n\nEbola-zaire: https://github.com/loculus-project/loculus/blob/show_geoloc_diffs/ingest/metadata_merged_ebola-zaire_unique.tsv\nWest-nile: https://github.com/loculus-project/loculus/blob/show_geoloc_diffs/ingest/metadata_merged_west-nile_unique.tsv\n\nPR Checklist\n\n\n Update version_comment field with previous geolocation information if changed due to fuzzy matching\n Add additional geoLocAdmin1 curation list for not caught cases e.g. Attica etc.",

This was not intended, and now by default, all components will render as page partials: only the contents of the components without a page shell.\nTo render the component as a full-fledged Astro page, pass a new option called partial: false to renderToString() and renderToResponse():\nimport { experimental_AstroContainer as AstroContainer } from 'astro/container';\nimport Card from '../src/components/Card.astro';\nconst container = AstroContainer.create();\nawait container.renderToString(Card); // the string will not contain &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\nawait container.renderToString(Card, { partial: false }); // the string will contain &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n\n\nastro@4.16.5\nPatch Changes\n\n#12232 ff68ba5 Thanks @\u200bmartrapp! - Fixes an issue with cssesc in dev mode when setting vite.ssr.noExternal: true\n\n\n\n\nChangelog\nSourced from astro's changelog.\n\n4.16.6\nPatch Changes\n\n\n#11823 a3d30a6 Thanks @\u200bDerTimonius! - fix: improve error message when inferSize is used in local images with the Image component\n\n\n#12227 8b1a641 Thanks @\u200bflorian-lefebvre! - Fixes a case where environment variables would not be refreshed when using astro:env\n\n\n#12239 2b6daa5 Thanks @\u200bematipic",

The new module structure and API focuses on three core principles:\n\n\nruntime compatibility (adding support for Deno, Cloudflare Workers, Bun, and other Web API interoperable runtimes)\ntree-shakeability (bundles should not contain features that don't end up being used)\nless options (removing support for processing deprecated response types, cutting down on the number of combinations that need to handled)\n\nTo that end openid-client@6 no longer supports the full cartesian matrix of response types and response modes, it no longer supports issuing encrypted assertions, decrypting assertions is limited to only a few algorithms, it no longer supports Dynamic Client Registration or Management, and Self-Issued OpenID Provider responses are also not supported.\nThe new API makes basic setups simple while allowing some degree of complexity where needed.\n\n\n...

However, as revocations do not have original metadata fields I had to add a new column just for the versionComment for revocations. The versionComment in revisions should just be treated as a normal metadata field. However, the field in the column and in the metadata need to be merged in get-released-data and here the contents of the versionComment column were overwriting the contents of the contents of the metadata field - this PR fixes the merge problem.\nScreenshot\n\nRevisions work again - can be made via page and show up:\n\nRevocations also still work:\n\nPR Checklist\n\n\n All necessary documentation has been adapted.\n The implemented feature is covered by an appropriate test.",

It calculates what this is and if it doesn't match the current captured file the check fails. To make the check pass you can add the update_db_schema label which will cause the CI to write over that schema file with the current schema.\nPurpose: to make it easy to see diffs in schema, allows seeing the current schema without having to manually add up all migrations in one's head\nLimitations:\nCI does not re-run after the auto-update. I consider that out of scope for this PR.\nI'm not sure if migrations will change order - maybe there is a way to make the order more deterministic?",

This means that we have to delete these files on the Pathoplexus-side again because .astro files preceed .mdx files. @theosanderson, do you think that's a reasonable solution?\nThe search form help button and the link to the authentication API docs now point to the Loculus docs. The variables are in separate files so that they can be easily overwritten by Pathoplexus.

    "body": "resolves #2793\npreview URL: https://enforce-schema.loculus.org\nWhat does this PR solve?\nThis PR resolves 2 issues discussed among others in #2793 but recapitulated here:\n\nWe were wasting db storage and bandwidth by storing lots of metadata fields with null values in sequence_entries_preprocessed_data.processed_data in the db - in Pathoplexus this wastage might even be 50% or more of total row size, reaching a point that's worth optimizing.\nWhenever we wanted to add a new metadata field, we needed to reprocess the data because the backend would rigidly send exactly what it had in sequence_entries_preprocessed_data.processed_data to the get-released-data consumer and SILO's preprocessing doesn't like missing (or extra as well, I think) fields in NDJSON. This created a lot of friction in deployment.\n\nWhat does this PR do?\nThis PR introduces the idea of metadata compression, in parallel to the existing sequence compression. This fits very nicely into the existing code base, making the actual code (non-test) changes trivial.\n\nProcessed metadata is compressed before being stored in the db by removing all fields that have null values: \n  \n    \n      loculus/backend/src/main/kotlin/org/loculus/backend/service/submission/CompressionService.kt\n    \n    \n         Line 121\n      in\n      6716149\n    \n  \n  \n    \n\n        \n          \n           processedData.metadata.filterNot { (_, value) -> value.isNull }, \n        \n    \n  \n\n\nProcessed metadata is decompressed after being retrieved from the db by filling back null to all the fields that are missing. At the same time, fields that are no longer in the current metadata schema are dropped so as to allow us to remove no-longer-wanted metadata fields: \n  \n    \n      loculus/backend/src/main/kotlin/org/loculus/backend/service/submission/CompressionService.kt\n    \n    \n        Lines 89 to 96\n      in\n      6716149\n    \n  \n  \n    \n\n        \n          \n           backendConfig \n        \n\n        \n          \n               .getInstanceCon",

This is to make sure that even if #3252 doesn't delete 100% of entries and some slip through it has no effect on processing pipeline updates. This also means existing instances don't need to clean up processed data to avoid #3250.\nIt'd be nice if we could rewrite the single big SQL update statement into chunks so we can do some informative logging of intermediate results to help with debugging updates that are in process, see #3249 - but that's for another time.\nOnce we have foreign key constraints we can probably remove the inner join again.\nTesting\nI tested deleting some sequences then updating prepro version and it worked (PR #3256)",

What made it worse was that each of the calls was hugely inefficient, using a join on data use terms, ordering by accession column and much more that is totally unnecessary for the counts calculation.\nThe fluctuation could be fixed by higher transaction isolation but this is much much faster and efficient so should be enough (I've profiled with simple logs and tested).\nAlso fixes fact that log message misses mention of some filters.\nFuture work\nThere's still lots to be done but this goes some way and fixes the inconsistency bug.\nWe should not have this single endpoint that calculates much more than necessary. It's behind the review page slowness #3269: we really just want total numbers of sequences to review but the backend needs to send loads of unnecessary information to the website simply because we have no simpler endpoint.\nInstead, we should spin up a few simple endpoints that do what the website needs - let's mark them as \"non-public\" in the backend API docs so that we don't need stability guarantees, they should be used solely by the website.\nScreenshot\nReload the page and look at both screencasts together to see speedup.\nThis PR:\n\nBefore (main):\n\nPR Checklist\n\n\n All necessary documentation has been adapted.\n The implemented feature is covered by an appropriate test.",

For example:\nBefore:\n<code class=\"astro-code\" style=\"background-color: #24292e\">\n  <pre>\n    <span class=\"line\" style=\"color: #e1e4e8\">my code</span>\n  </pre>\n</code>\nAfter:\n<code class=\"astro-code\" style=\"background-color: #24292e; color: #e1e4e8\">\n  <pre>\n    <span class=\"line\">my code<span>\n  </pre>\n</code>\nThis does not affect the colors as the span will inherit the color from the parent, but if you're relying on a specific HTML markup, please check your site carefully after upgrading to verify the styles.\n\n\nPatch Changes\n\nUpdated dependencies [2993055be, c4270e476, bd5aa1cd3, f369fa250, 391729686, f999365b8, b2ae9ee0c, 0abff97fe, 3bef32f81]:\n\nastro@3.3.0\n\n\n\nastro@3.3.0\nMinor Changes\n\n\n#8808 2993055be Thanks @\u200bdelucis! - Adds support for an --outDir CLI flag to astro build\n\n\n#8502 c4270e476 Thanks @\u200bbluwy! - Updates the internal shiki syntax highlighter to shikiji, an ESM-focus",

Please follow the Migration guidelines to upgrade. This release took a lot of effort to make, and I expect a bit of that effort on your part while upgrading. Most of the changes are mechanical, and a simple Find/Replace All will get you a long way. For the rest of it, you will learn how to handle requests and responses using the standard JavaScript API. Thank you!\n\nBreaking changes\n\nDrops support for Node.js 16. Please upgrade to Node.js 18 or later to use the global Fetch API.\nDrops support for TypeScript < 4.7.\nAll browser-side exports, like setupWorker, SetupWorkerApi, etc., must be imported from msw/browser now.\nRenames the rest object to http (rest.get -> http.get).\n\n\nResponse resolver call signature is no longer (req, res, ctx) => res() but instead ({ request }) => new Response().\n\n\nThe following exports are removed due to no longer being needed:\n\nresponse\ncontext and related exports (defaultContext, restContext, graphqlContext).\ncompose and createResponseComposition\n\n\nres.once() is removed in favor of the { once: boolean } option on the request handler.\nReplaces the .printHandlers() method with .listHandlers().\nRemoves the NetworkError class in favor of the standard Response.error().\nMoves request error handling from the worker thread to the client thread.\nChanges the call signature of the Life-cycle Events API to accept a single object argument.\nUses crypto.randomUUID() instead of Math.random() in the worker.\nFor the full list of changes and detailed instructions on how to upgrade please see the Migration guidelines.\n\nFeatures\n\nAdopts Fetch API primitives.

Please follow the Migration guidelines to upgrade. This release took a lot of effort to make, and I expect a bit of that effort on your part while upgrading. Most of the changes are mechanical, and a simple Find/Replace All will get you a long way. For the rest of it, you will learn how to handle requests and responses using the standard JavaScript API. Thank you!\n\nBreaking changes\n\nDrops support for Node.js 16. Please upgrade to Node.js 18 or later to use the global Fetch API.\nDrops support for TypeScript < 4.7.\nAll browser-side exports, like setupWorker, SetupWorkerApi, etc., must be imported from msw/browser now.\nRenames the rest object to http (rest.get -> http.get).\n\n\nResponse resolver call signature is no longer (req, res, ctx) => res() but instead ({ request }) => new Response().\n\n\nThe following exports are removed due to no longer being needed:\n\nresponse\ncontext and related exports (defaultContext, restContext, graphqlContext).\ncompose and createResponseComposition\n\n\nres.once() is removed in favor of the { once: boolean } option on the request handler.\nReplaces the .printHandlers() method with .listHandlers().\nRemoves the NetworkError class in favor of the standard Response.error().\nMoves request error handling from the worker thread to the client thread.\nChanges the call signature of the Life-cycle Events API to accept a single object argument.\nUses crypto.randomUUID() instead of Math.random() in the worker.\nFor the full list of changes and detailed instructions on how to upgrade please see the Migration guidelines.\n\nFeatures\n\nAdopts Fetch API primitives. Represent intercepted requests and mocked responses as Request and Response instances respectively.\nSupports Node.js v18.\nSupport",

Please follow the Migration guidelines to upgrade. This release took a lot of effort to make, and I expect a bit of that effort on your part while upgrading. Most of the changes are mechanical, and a simple Find/Replace All will get you a long way. For the rest of it, you will learn how to handle requests and responses using the standard JavaScript API. Thank you!\n\nBreaking changes\n\nDrops support for Node.js 16. Please upgrade to Node.js 18 or later to use the global Fetch API.\nDrops support for TypeScript < 4.7.\nAll browser-side exports, like setupWorker, SetupWorkerApi, etc., must be imported from msw/browser now.\nRenames the rest object to http (rest.get -> http.get).\n\n\nResponse resolver call signature is no longer (req, res, ctx) => res() but instead ({ request }) => new Response().\n\n\nThe following exports are removed due to no longer being needed:\n\nresponse\ncontext and related exports (defaultContext, restContext, graphqlContext).\ncompose and createResponseComposition\n\n\nres.once() is removed in favor of the { once: boolean } option on the req",

    "body": "This PR aims to improve the search form on mobile devices by moving it to an off-canvas. It also takes up the idea in #82 and made the search button (on desktop and on mobile) sticky and always visible.\n\nCode-wise, I extracted some code from the off-canvas navigation and created a useOffCanvas hook, an OffCanvasOverlay component, and a CSS class offCanvasTransform. Happy to receive feedback on whether this is a good way to reuse the code. I thought about creating a reusable OffCanvas component but didn't really know how.\nI didn't write any test for this PR. Regarding e2e tests, I suggest that we first wait for #63. We could test the useOffCanvas hook but as it is really simple, I'm not sure whether it is worth setting up something like react-hooks-testing-library (which itself recommends that simple hooks that are closely tied to a component should be simply tested with the components).",

This is a default and can be overridden with a custom ObjectMapper if desired.\nPassword-based JWE encryption key algorithms (PBES2_HS256_A128KW, PBES2_HS384_A192KW and PBES2_HS512_A256KW) now enforce an upper bound (maximum) number of iterations allowed during decryption to mitigate against potential DoS attacks. Many thanks to Jingcheng Yang and Jianjun Chen from Sichuan University and Zhongguancun Lab for their work on this!\n\nA number of other issues fixed: thread-safe ServiceLoader usage for dynamic JSON processor lookup, Android enhancements for JSON Reader APIs, fixed Elliptic Curve field element padding, and more.

One limitation to Astro's existing approach has been that you could not dynamically use hoisted scripts. Each page received the same, all-inclusive bundle whether or not every script was needed on that page.\nNow, Astro has improved the static analysis to take into account the actual imports used.\nFor exam",

But in general, normal searches will stay in the URL, as in the preview for this branch: https://searchpost.loculus.org/\nI've also added a dev-feature that expands the \"Load example data\" to load any number of randomly created entries which is important for testing pagination and should also help with testing submission features.\nPR Checklist\n\n\n All necessary documentation has been adapted.\n The implemented feature is covered by an appropriate test.",

We have decided to create an issue now for visibility and tracking purposes.\nIssue\nOn Thursday, 29th August, we identified and fixed a bug in a Loculus dependency, SILO (see loculus-project/loculus#2666). The bug meant that bulk downloads of unaligned nucleotide sequences from Pathoplexus were incorrect. The fix was rolled out to Pathoplexus in #60.\nSeverity:\nThis issue affected the endpoint for the download of bulk raw nucleotide sequences. It did not affect the sequences displayed on individual pages, the download of metadata or the download of bulk aligned sequences.\nImpact:\nThe estimated impact is low. Analytics show a small proportion of users accessed the Browse pages (which were not themselves impacted). Of users who access the Browse pages, a very small proportion make a download. If users were making downloads, we believe that they were likely doing so to test out the website functionality and that . The error was such that it would be clearly apparent in any analyses that were made. The bug was detected internally within the SILO team rather than being reported by users.\nDetails of the SILO bug can be found here: GenSpectrum/LAPIS-SILO#549",

For example, do we just want to link to 'live' things (if so, what does this mean?), or are we open to people also linking to static analysis results/papers? Do we want to link to code that doesn't use Pathoplexus directly but enables its use, either on front or backend?",
